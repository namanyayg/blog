| Google a Day for 1st January 2k12. Love the clean interface ðŸ˜€ |

  





### What is it?

> There is no right way to solve it, but thereâ€™s only one right answer. Find the answer with your creativity and clever search skills.
> 

[A google a day](http://agoogleaday.com/) is a fun game, which can be enjoyed by all people. It starts with a question asked by google, and, you guessed it right, there is a new one everyday. The questions asked are quite easyâ€¦
The point is that you have to search for the answer. Google Provides you Tips and Tricks (Press â€˜sâ€™ for all tricks you can use on google) and hints (that will surely help you get to the answer)
If all fails, there is an option to see the answer. There you will also get to know what was the simplest way to get to the answer.




### How Does it Work? What is â€˜Deja Googleâ€™

A Google a Day works on Deja Google, which has the name taken from â€˜**[DÃ©jÃ  vu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A9j%C3%A0_vu)â€˜** which literally means â€˜already seenâ€™
Deja Google allows you to search the internet before â€˜Google a Dayâ€™ existed, as to get spoiler-free experience.
It is apparently a wormhole inspired time machine. (Nice sense of humour there google!)
  






### How to win at a Google a Day?

The best thing you can do is to utilize all google tricks (press â€˜sâ€™) and use a bit of common sense â€“ not much help can be done.



### Win or not?

  


Google a day, certainly a win. It combines fun, as well as learning about google. A great marketing strategy if properly advertised. Nice, clean interface. A must play.
PS. Grab the [a google a day app](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jfffneapblebcpnkjdocjgopbajigool)!
