[Rainmeter](http://rainmeter.net/RainCMS/?q=About) is a Software that is like windows 7 and vista gadgets, but a lot better. From the About page of Rainmeter- 
  
> Rainmeter is a desktop customization platform. Through Rainmeter, you can enhance your Windows computer at home or work with skins: handy, compact applets which float freely on your desktop, much like Windows Sidebar gagdgets, or dashboard widgets for the Mac. **Rainmeter skins provide you with useful information at a glance.** It’s easy to keep an eye on your system resources, like memory and battery power, or your online data streams, including email, RSS feeds, and weather forecasts. Many skins are even functional: they can record your notes and to-do lists, launch your favorite applications, and send your tweets to Twitter – all in a clean, unobtrusive interface that you can rearrange and customize to your liking.

  

Install – 
To start, just [install rainmeter](http://rainmeter.net/RainCMS/).
Then, choose a cool theme from the [Download page](http://rainmeter.net/RainCMS/?q=Downloads) and install it. I have chosen [Enigma](http://rainmeter.net/RainCMS/?q=Suites_Enigma).
  

You’ve got the Rainnmeter ! Right now, it would look empty and without much style, but you can customize all of that.

Here is the starting picture of Engima, and a zoomed view of the options.

| Enigma Options    |

Hope you haven’t closed the option screen already. If you have, then just **right click** on the sidebar, choose **Enigma** and click on **Options.ini**. 

The options screen will be visible again. Now, you have to customize the option pages suiting to yourself. Go through the tabs at left and enter the required fields. If you have any problem, just visit the [Rainmeter Tips and Tricks](http://rainmeter.net/RainCMS/?q=TipsAndTricks) and the [Rainmeter 101](http://rainmeter.net/RainCMS/?q=Rainmeter101).  

Hope you now have filled all the fields in the options. Now, to get the corresponding widgets.To get those, just right click on the Enigma Sidebar/Taskbar and Choose Enigma, then Sidebar/Taskbar, and choose the corresponding ‘skin’.   

Remember you change the order of the skins, and even take them off the sidebar/taskbar. Play with it, learn something, and make your desktop cooler.

Till then, Live long and Prosper, my friend.
