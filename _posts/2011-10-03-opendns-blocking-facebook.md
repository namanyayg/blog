| OpenDNS : Guarrenteed to not let you Open Any Site. <strike>(I know, that was lame)</strike> |

And I was like : Oh Shit. I knew I should’ve backed up my older [DNS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System)… (To those who don’t know what OpenDNS is, you can learn more about it on [its homepage](http://www.opendns.com/))
  

Well, I thought that OpenDNS was messing around with it’s security. Gladly, just one hit of refresh, and I was back to that [blue <strike>screen of death</strike> and white social network](http://create-n.blogspot.com/search/label/Facebook). 
  

Just hoping it does not occur often, or else I’ll have to switch back to MTNL’s [DNS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System).
