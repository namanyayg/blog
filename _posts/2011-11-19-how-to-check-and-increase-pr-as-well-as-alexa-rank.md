 Bloggers all around the world write content and publish it, and are racing to be the best. For that, you need to have a ranking system. There are currently two main ranking systems, Google PageRank (Name from Google CEO Larry Page), and Alexa rank. This article will tell you how to check your ranks, as well as increase them. 

 
**Check Ranks-**  

**Google PageRank.**   
  
  
Checking Google Pagerank is quite easy. There’s an [Online PR checker](http://prchecker.info/), which I am using myself.

**Alexa Rank.**   
  
  
Alexa is now one of the main things to look to check the value of the site, and it’s ranking system isn’t accurate until you do something yourself to increase Alexa Rank.

To find out your alexa rank, you need to download the [alexa toolbar](http://www.alexa.com/toolbar). This toolbar will give the Alexa Rank for any website.

![Alexa Chrome Extension](http://www.alexa.com/images/toolbar/chrome.jpg)

Just Visit a website of your choice, and see the button for it’s alexa rank. The length of the filled bar indicates the rank. You can get detailed Statistics about the site once you click the button.

**How To increase them-** 
  

**Google PageRank**  
  
  
Increasing google pagerank is quite difficult, and there is no sure way to improve it. One of the main things is getting back links from other sites, and not only any backlinks, high quality backlinks. The higher the PR of the blog you get a backlink from, the higher your PR gets.

[![](http://cdn.jobmob.co.il/images/articles/logos/myblogguest-logo.png)](http://cdn.jobmob.co.il/images/articles/logos/myblogguest-logo.png)One of the best ways to get backlinks is to guest post on other blogs. This will get a backlink, and google will see it as a high-quality backlink. (TIP: [Start with a post on my blog!](http://create-n.blogspot.com/p/write-guest-post.html))

You can look for opportunities to Guest Post on an online Guest Blogging Forum, [MyBlogGuest](http://myblogguest.com/).

Just Sign-Up, and visit the forums, and Guest Post at places!

Also, ensure that all links going out of your site are either trusted, or marked as ‘nofollow’ (do this by adding rel=’nofollow’ in tag) Google’s new Panda Update punishes spammers, so be wary…

**Alexa Rank**  

[  ](http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=4552098295357212299)  
At start, my Alexa rank was 2 sites linking in, whearas it displayed around 50 in yahoo link checker. After installing the [toolbar](http://www.alexa.com/toolbar), my links climbed to 16. I realized when people visit my site and load something from Alexa, Alexa checks my site again. So, I thought of including a widget in my site.

Building a widget was easy. I went to it’s ‘[widget](http://www.alexa.com/siteowners/widgets)‘ page, and I got a widget, and placed it in my footer.  
Using that, links in changed to 22 in some days, and now are upto 39. Hope the reach the actual value soon.

If you got other methods, or benefited from these, do leave a comment!
