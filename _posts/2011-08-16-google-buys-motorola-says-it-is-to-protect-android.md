**[Google](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/08/supercharging-android-google-to-acquire.html)** will buy Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, itt has announced. Google says it is an effort to “protect Android and its eco-system” from Apple, Microsoft and others.  
  
  
Motorola made few of the best phones in this and the previous years, with the best hardware. Good Hardware with Android was not enough, and it sales were going down.   
  
  
Larry Page, the CEO of Google, says that Motorola will have a different department, and it is only to accelerate the growth of Android.
