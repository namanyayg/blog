Hiya Guys!  
  
  
If you know, these days, I’m maintaining my [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/) Account as well. I am uploading Tutorials these days.  
If you don’t know already, [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/) is a free video sharing service.  
  
  
So, Today I uploaded a Video Tutorial to change your Youtube Background. Here is the Video , Watch it in HD too!  
  
<embed height="266" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Y7DFJT4J6eU?f=user_uploads&c=google-webdrive-0&app=youtube_gdata" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="320">
  
I am Using Photoshop CS5.5 in this Tutorial. If you Don’t Have the Time for the basics, here is a text tutorial too!  
1.  Download the [Template Files](https://sites.google.com/site/imrockinboystube/templates-and-my-theme/YoutubeTemplate.zip?attredirects=0&d=1).
2. Extract them, an open up ‘Youtube Temp.PSD’ in the folder ‘Youtube Template’ if you have photoshop. If you don’t, use the PNG file on other Editors such as Gimp or Paint Shop Pro.. 
3. There would be the layout for Youtube. Make any Changes, and then Lock the layer. 
4. Create a background and as background, info, anything you wish.
5. Save this as .jpeg
6. Go to your Channel, and choose the ‘Themes and Colours’ tab on top.
7. Click on ‘Show Advanced Options’ 
8. Name your theme, and Upload a file to ‘Background Image’
9. You can modify the colors of the text too! Go to [HTML Color Codes](http://www.computerhope.com/htmcolor.htm) and copy paste any ‘Code’ for the color you want.
10. Save changes, and you’re done!

Comment and give me the link to your channel, as I want to see what you created too! [My Background](https://sites.google.com/site/imrockinboystube/templates-and-my-theme/YoutubeBackgroundFinal.jpg?attredirects=0&d=1), for reference purposes
