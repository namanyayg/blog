A Short post regarding the founding of a latest scam site, buy-a-computer .info. 
It recently came in my stats, so, naturally, as a blogger, I had to check it out. 
  

Fortunately, my Antivirus stopped me from viewing the website, and only the header was loaded… A site full of malicious intent, be wary, and do not clock on the blogger link. 

Also saw it redirecting to something like anything-and-everything.co.cc (Don’t remember the address fully…)
So if any of you guys stumble upon it, press the back button as quick as you can.
  

Be safe, be technologically sane.
