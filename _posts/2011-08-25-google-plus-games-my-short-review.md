You may have heard earlier guys, that Google+ has released Games.  
If not, check out [Google Plus has Released Games â€“ Create-n](http://create-n.blogspot.com/2011/08/google-plus-has-released-games.html)  
  
  
So, now you have an Idea of [Games on G+](https://plus.google.com/games).  
If you were lucky that you got the Games Stream now, check this out.  
  
  
Most of the Games on G+ are plain TRASH. They are all timing and stuff, like â€˜to build x, wait for y minutesâ€™ and â€˜y minutes remaining to complete task xâ€™ . At the start the may seem fun, but the do get boring at the later levels. So many of these games, like [EdgeWorld](https://plus.google.com/games/601508054763) , [Dragons of Atlantis](https://plus.google.com/games/659749063556), and more, are totally hell. They are too bad to play. Donâ€™t even think of playing them, until you are very patient, and have time to burn.  
  
  
The only good Games i saw were   
  
  
  
  
  
Angry Birds, Zynga Poker, and [Crime City](https://plus.google.com/games/865772480172).| [![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-LALuGfWYGIw/TlY1u-0TkBI/AAAAAAAAASc/I5HahG5Rqy0/s400/Hood_CC.png)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-LALuGfWYGIw/TlY1u-0TkBI/AAAAAAAAASc/I5HahG5Rqy0/s1600/Hood_CC.png) |

Ahh! [Crime City](https://plus.google.com/games/865772480172). One of my favourite Games. Nice Graphics, nice Gameplay.  
Its the best IMHO. Join me now, and lets defeat some goons together ðŸ˜€
