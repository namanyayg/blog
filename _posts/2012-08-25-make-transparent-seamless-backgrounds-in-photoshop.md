If you design websites, you surely would be making textures for them in Photoshop. The most tiring thing is to change the background color *each time* you wish to use it somewhere else. The solution to this annoyance is simple â€“ make transparent, seamless backgrounds**.**

After a lot of experimenting, I found an easy way to do just that. This post, which is the first part of many to come, will show how easily you can make a transparent, seamless **noise** background using photoshop.

Hereâ€™s what the end result will look like, note that itâ€™s the *same texture* on all three color swatches (The first one is transparent, so you might not be able to see it)

Letâ€™s start making a transparent, seamless background!

- Open up a **200 by 200** canvas in Photoshop.
- Make the background layer editable (double click). Make sure the background color is white.
- Click on Filter &gt; Noise &gt; Add noise. Set it around 2-4%.
- **Double click** on the layer to open blending options.
- Under â€˜Blend if \[Grey\]â€™, drag the **first slider** from right to left, making the value 254 from (255).  
    *This step removes all white from the layer.*![Transparent Seamless BG Photoshop Step 2](http://i.symmetrycode.com/TransparentSeamlessBGPhotoshopStep2.png "Transparent Seamless BG Photoshop Step 2")
- Make one more layer, merge the previous layer with it.  
    This step makes the blending permanent.*
- Set opacity to around **10-15%,** blend mode overlay.**
- Finished!

Wasnâ€™t that tough, was it?

You got an amazing looking background, which you can use anywhere!

Hereâ€™s the PNG for people who wish to use it *(Just right click on the empty area below, and use it)*

*(PS. Iâ€™ve been using this trick on my blog. The background for the â€˜continue readingâ€™ button, and the menu bar are the same ðŸ˜‰ )*
