The Chain Letter says that- 

> “They pushed her down a sewer. 
>   
> About 6 years ago in Indiana, Carmen Winstead was pushed down a sewer opening by five girls in her school trying to embarrass her in front of the whole school during a fire drill. When she didn’t submerge the police were called. They went down and brought up 17 year old Carmen Winstead’s body, her neck broken by hitting a ladder, then side concrete at the bottom. The girls told… everyone she fell… They believed them.
> 
> FACT: 2 months ago, 16 year old David Gregory read this post ad didn’t repost it. When he went to take a shower he heard laughter from his shower, he started freaking out and ran to his computer to repost it, He said goodnight to his mom and went to sleep, 5 hours later his mom woke up in the middle of the night cause of a loud noise, David was gone, that morning a few hours later the police found him on the sewer, his neck broke and his face skin peeled off.”




The Evidence That This Is False 

  


- How did the person know that she were pushed? If they were, why were the girls not arrested?
- Indiana Database reports no girl by the name of Carmen Winstead with this kind of death, nor any other person who died in a sewer.
- This message has been going on since times of Myspace. Obviously, not posting wouldn’t result in death, so don’t worry. 


What To Do If I have Reposted/Witnessed the spam

  
If you are one of those who have reposted, you are lucky to get on this site. Reposting just makes you look dumb. If you have reposted, quickly delete it. Then the following applies to both witness, and reposters.   
Go to the status, and just comment the following – > Totally False. I have Read about it, and there is no proof of this. You should soon delete it. Read the evidence at <http://create-n.blogspot.com/2011/12/facebook-chain-message-carmen-winstead.html>

That should do the trick 😉
  

If the person still doesn’t listen, just pester him on chat with the exact same messege. He/she soon will 😀
