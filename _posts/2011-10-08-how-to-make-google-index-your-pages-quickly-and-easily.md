Does Google Take Time to Index your Siteâ€™s Pages, and you think that you could have got more hits earlier if Google had quickly indexed your site? Want a solution to it? Just submit your Sitemap to Google Webmasters.
  

If you use blogger, then Google Webmaster would have automatically authorized you as the siteâ€™s owner. If not, [Follow these instructions to add your site](http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=34592).
  

Now the Instructions to Submit your Sitemap-

  

Go to [Google Webmasters](http://www.google.com/webmasters/) and sign in. Then Click on your siteâ€™s URL for which you want to submit Sitemap.| [![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-l2G7xvYF7js/TpBTLrrlA9I/AAAAAAAAAWg/TzweFdZ_NCs/s1600/SubmitSitemap01.png)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-l2G7xvYF7js/TpBTLrrlA9I/AAAAAAAAAWg/TzweFdZ_NCs/s1600/SubmitSitemap01.png) |

| Click on the URL, nothing elseâ€¦ |

  
There would be a box of sitemaps (which would probably be empty now) in the bottom right corner. Click â€˜moreâ€™ (or any similar button) which is below it.
  

Click on â€˜Submit a Sitemapâ€™. A box will drop down.

In this box, enter the following codes. Remember to submit it line by line.  

```

atom.xml?redirect=falsestart-index=3001max-results=500
  
atom.xml?redirect=falsestart-index=501max-results=500  
```
  
This will submit your RSS/Atom feed to Google.   
Advantage of using this is that Google will index your site pages faster, meaning more visits quicker.
