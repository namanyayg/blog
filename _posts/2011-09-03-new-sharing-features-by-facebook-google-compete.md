Facebook Has Launched [new Sharing Features](http://www.facebook.com/about/sharing/), and they are available to all, at least in India.
  

What’s New –
  
- It has Added a ‘**Tag**‘ Button
- Added a ‘**Location**‘ tag Button
- Added **Privacy Buttons in the post itself.** You can change these settings after you have posted, too. 

Some new Features with the [New Tag feature](http://www.facebook.com/about/tagging/)…

  

  

### Removing and Reporting Tags

If you don’t like a tag that someone adds, you have many options:1. Remove it from your profile. Your profile represents who you are, so you control what appears on it. You can even update your [privacy settings](http://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=privacy) to review things you’re tagged in *before* they go on your profile.
2. Remove the tag or report the post. You can easily:

- Remove the tag. The post will still be on Facebook, but it will no longer link to your profile.
- Send the owner of the post a message, asking to remove the post from Facebook.
- Report a post to Facebook. If the post is abusive, it will be removed.
- **Block the owner of the post.** All tags from this person will be removed, and you will no longer be able to see or interact with each other on Facebook.

| Sharing with ‘Friends’ Only |

  
New Features with the [‘Locations’ Tag](http://www.facebook.com/about/location/)  





Add where you are to anything you share  


In the past, you needed a smart phone to easily share your location. Now you can share your location from your computer, too, and say:

- Where you’ve been. Remember where you were in your favorite photos.
- Where you are now. If friends are nearby, they might just meet you there.
- Where you’re going. Friends who have been there can give you tips or even join in the plan.

| Location |

You also have to ‘Approve’ tags. This means, your friends CAN’T Tag you anymore until your permission is given. If they do, you can easily remove it. 
  

This means that they cannot make your facebook banner look silly.
