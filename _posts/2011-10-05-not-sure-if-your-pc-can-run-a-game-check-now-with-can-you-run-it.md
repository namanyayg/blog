Download the file, and after you’re done, hit refresh.You will be either –- Get the system requirements with recommended as well as minimum tabs
- Get system requirements with either recommended OR minimum tab
- Get a video advertisement

If you get the advertisement, a refresh is recommended. Refresh, and you should get option 1 or option 2. If you got option 2, sadly, you will get either one of minimum or recommended.   
You will get upgrade suggestions too, if your computer doesn’t meet the minimum requirement. Hope it helped for your next buy!
