You must be thinking what is Blackle?
  

It is a creation of [Heap Media](http://www.heapmedia.com/), an energy saving google alternative.
It is a search page, with Google Custom Search.
  

It works on the policy that Google’s white background wastes too much energy, which can be easily saved, hence its creation. 
  

“Image displayed is primarily a function of the user’s color settings and desktop graphics, as well as the color and size of open application windows; a given monitor requires more power to display a white (or light) screen than a black (or dark) screen.”
  

  

  

It’s source of inspiration is a blog post, titled [Black Google Would Save 750 Megawatt-hours a Year](http://ecoiron.blogspot.com/2007/01/black-google-would-save-3000-megawatts.html). The theory is that using a black screen would save 8.3 Megawatt-hours per day, or about 3000 Megawatt-hours a year. And, taking in consideration that 25% of the world’s monitors are CRT, that will save $75,000 per year. Much ?
  

A direct Quote –> “We believe that there is value in the concept because even if the energy savings are small, they all add up. Secondly we feel that seeing Blackle every time we load our web browser reminds us that we need to keep taking small steps to save energy.”
