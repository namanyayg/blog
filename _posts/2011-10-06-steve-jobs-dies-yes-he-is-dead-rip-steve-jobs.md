| Steve Jobs 1955-2011 |

“Apple has lost a visionary and a creative genius, and the world has lost an amazing human being. Those who have been fortunate enough to know and work with Steve have lost a dear friend and an inspiring mentor. Steve leaves behind a Company that only he could have built, and his spirit will forever be the foundation of Apple”

[Apple’s Dedication to Steve Jobs](http://www.apple.com/stevejobs/)  
  

Yeah Guys. Steve Jobs Died. But the good thing is,
that he dies with his Family around him. He was dedicated to his work life, but in his personal life, he spent a lot of time with his family. He died with his wife, who he was dating before marriage, and his daughter. My Condolence to Jobs. RIP. You can mail him condolence at the official Steve jobs RIP ID
