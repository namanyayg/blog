Keep on Facebook. Keep on Cheating.  
Thank you for giving me stuff to fill my blog with. With this post, I Have more than 3000 views. 
  

Facebook’s new **[Improved Friend Lists](http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=10150278932602131)** feature has a striking resemblance to Google+’s Circles. Co Incidence, or desperate Facebook? I think it is the latter. 
  

Facebook Says – 

> *This week, it will be easier than ever to see more from the people you care about and simpler to share with exactly the right people using Friend Lists.*

Seriously Facebook? What about Circles?
  



>  
> *To make lists incredibly easy and even more useful, we’re announcing three improvements:*
> 
> 1. ***Smart lists***
> * – You’ll see smart lists that create themselves and stay up-to-date based on profile info your friends have in common with you–like your work, school, family and city.*
> 
> 
> 
> 
> - ***Close Friends and Acquaintances lists***
> * – You can see your best friends’ photos and posts in one place, and see less from people you’re not as close to.*
> 
> 
> - ***Better suggestions***
> * – You can add the right friends to your lists without a lot of effort.*

1. Oh Wow. Smart Lists! So helpful! /sarcasm

  


- Close Friends and Acquaintances Lists. Just added a ‘Close’ to Differentiate it with G+ 

- Better Suggestions- Doesn’t it already exist?

  
> ***Smart Lists**Managing lists is boring. That’s why smart lists do the work for you. To start, we’ll offer you smart lists for:*
> 
> *1. Work* 
> 
> 
> - School
> 
> - Family
> 
> - City
> 
> For instance, if you list Boston College as a school you’ve attended and your friends John and Sarah do too, then you would instantly have a smart list called “Boston College” with John and Sarah on it. This means that if you’re having a grad party or a college reunion, you can easily share photos with just your college friends, without bothering other people you know.
> 
> You can also add or remove friends manually to make the lists even more accurate.



“Managing Lists is Boring” – They Finally Realized, Circles are **Damn better.**

“You can also add or remove friends manually….” As if it was not obvious :/

> - **Close Friends and Acquaintances Lists**
> 
> - **Close Friends list**
>  – Add your best friends to your Close Friends list and you’ll see everything they post in News Feed. You can even jump straight to a view of your News Feed that only shows their photos and news. You can also receive notifications when they post updates, so you don’t miss anything important.
> 
> 
> - **Acquaintances list** 
> – Add friends like old classmates or business contacts to your Acquaintances list and you’ll see less of them in your News Feed. We’ll still show you important things they post — like when they get married or move to a new city — so you don’t lose touch completely.

“Close Friends List” – Same with Circles!

And that what I sum it up too. You may have a different opinion, see the [official post](http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=10150278932602131) if you think you do.
