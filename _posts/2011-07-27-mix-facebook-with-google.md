Hello guys! Using Google+ for a time now.. But there has been a problem. Whenever I upload pictures, videos or anything interesting, I have to upload them BOTH on G+ and fb. Pretty Tiring.

So, I thought, there would be a way to mix their contentâ€¦.  
and here it comes! [Start Google plus](http://startgoogleplus.com/) .. Very handy app, it mixed my stream.  
Now i can update my fb status through G+ , and post comments through G+ .  
If you are a G+ user, it is recommended!

(Note : Some problems may be experienced when using the app through Firefox. However, Chrome works fine)

If you want a G+ invite, go to <http://sellingginvites.blogspot.com/>

Cya guys later!
