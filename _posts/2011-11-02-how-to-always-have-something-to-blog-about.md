Most Bloggers have problem getting quality content. One factor of quality content is quality inspiration. In this post I will share with you some tips that will help you know content at the right time, which is suitable for your niche.

- **Like Better Blogger’s Facebook Page(s) and Follow them on Twitter.** Best strategy by far. Always like and follow better bloggers in your Niche. For Tech Bloggers, I recommend following Lifehacker, Gizmodo, and ofcourse, me. You should also follow other bloggers, depending on what you like/get inspiration from. 


- **Learn from friends.** If your friend is a mobile addict, car addict, android addict, or something-related-to-your-niche addict, place him in a special List. This will give you easy access to his/her updates, and will tell you the latest news. You can [learn more about lists and smart lists](http://create-n.blogspot.com/2011/09/facebook-finally-releases-smart-lists.html).


- **Bookmark what you see.** If you get on a page of new software or something of that sort, bookmark it right away. I do this always, and thus always have reviews to write. Though you need to clean it up from time to time, or it will get too big. 

That’s it. Tell how it went for you, and what else do you do, in comments.
