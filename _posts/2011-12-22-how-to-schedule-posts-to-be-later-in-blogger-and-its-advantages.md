Scheduling post is a great feature, especially when you are in mood to write, and think that you will write, write and write. You may recieve a boost that day, but it isn‚Äôt good for SEO, and humans as well, as they have to much information in one day. If you write a lot in one day, you may also feel like not to write the other day, harming your SEO more. In this post, I will teach you how to schedule your post for later, and it‚Äôs advantages.



#### How-To 

After you have written your post, there is a option to schedule on the right sidebar.

Click on schedule, choose ‚ÄúSet Date and Time‚Äù

| Scheduled for 22/12 10:00 AM |

In the text box, write the time in 12 hour format your chosen time to post. I schedule posts at 10:00 AM, as that is the time when most people start browsing the web.

Choose the day from the calender below.


 Advantages

- You can write for later if you have to go to some function etc in the coming time.
- If you are feeling more write-y and creative, then you can do it all in one day, without hurting your SEO.
- You can set to schedule for a time in the day, if you write at night. Doing that will make the content fresh when people start browsing.
- You can schedule posts, and human visitors will know that you post at a specific time of the day.
