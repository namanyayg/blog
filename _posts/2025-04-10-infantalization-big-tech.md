The first time I encountered was getting invited to Googleplex at the age of 15 for winning [Google Code In](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2015/02/google-code-in-2014-welcome-to-winners.html).

They flew me and my family out to SF and showed us around the office. I was taking in everything in a blank state, before this I had barely seen any offices at all let alone a big tech co's office.

Still, being there gave me a sense of... unsettlement. These were supposed to be the smartest people in the world, yet they wore the same badge, had nap pods to sleep in, had games and sports, ate the same food at the same cafeterias.

I couldn't help but see this as a "playground for adults".

And swore to myself that I won't work in anything like this.

In the last few months, I've met a lot of cool people working in big tech jobs.

They are paid well, have a work-life balance tilted towards the latter, and enjoy multiple hobbies outside of work.

However, they **all seem to be frustrated at their jobs*.

Here are some facts about big tech companies:

* They pay extremely well
* They allow very flexible work schedules
* Employees usually work on very fragmented, tiny slivers of work
* Significant hour are spent in meetings, documentation, and communication
* Many employees are focused on "gaming" the political system for promotions

Given this, it makes a lot more sense why my big tech friends are unsatisfied.

However, one thing I only understood after reaching adulthood: **_why_ do the big tech companies _allow_ such a work culture?**

## Insiduous Reality

A type of "doublethink" seems to operate in the work culture of big tech (something which gives me large severance vibes)

I had started to realize this somewhat when I was first there during my teenage years. Given how they were demoing and showering us with free gifts for working on open source contributions that barely had any business use, I was reminded of the saying "if something is free, you are the product".

I realized that the "open source" competition existed purely to give students who know programming since a young age a taste of what working at Google is like, and get them excited about that company, and to make them start thinking about working at Google is like as soon as possible.

I later realized that this is because the main reason big tech companies massively overpay and give every amenity possible is: **they don't want talented individuals to _work anywhere else_*

## Don't let them work anywhere else

All the big tech companies know that if new talented kids actually got together, they can build business models that completely outcompete their traditional models.

So what do they do? They just don't let them work anywhere else.

They can't force anyone, so they have to do that by giving new talent what they want.

For that to happen, they have to capture all the right talent at the correct time.

And I'm calling "talent capture" to describe how they do it.

## Talent Capture

First, you have to figure out a way to capture talent from the top schools. Next, you have to retain them for at least 4-5 years. In that time, you can sap them of the courage of youth and build habits and mindset that makes it very difficult for them to do a startup. 

They have solved the first two steps by:

1. Just by giving them the best $$$ possible, not difficult with the insane profit margins in software.
2. The magic of "equity" and "vesting". By keeping a significant portion of their remuneration until they complete a certain time in their company (4 years), they effectively retain that talent for long, similar to dangling a carrot in front of them.
3. Offering all of this by giving new students plenty of opportunities to learn and make mistakes, rather than being too strict or harsh.

In that duration of 4 years, they:

* Encourage the individual to climb the hedonic treadmill, not difficult by making them feel awed by the lifestyle of people senior to them
* Get them comfortable with a certain lifestyle and monthly spend
*
