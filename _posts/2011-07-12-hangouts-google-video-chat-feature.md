Hola again pals.  
So, you see , I’m on google+ . (as on my previous post)  
and, I was just trying out the Hangouts! Feature.  
Though it sounds good, I had one big complaint:  
NO FEATURE TO NAME THE HANGOUT!!  
For example, I was looking for some people because I had to schedule more people to come on cs (Counter Strike) tonight. But! Alas! Google+ Cannot name the hangout!!! Though video chat is fun, it’s just not my type…  
and you can’t import your calender too! So I couldn’t schedule a event!  
Guess I’ll have to wait…
