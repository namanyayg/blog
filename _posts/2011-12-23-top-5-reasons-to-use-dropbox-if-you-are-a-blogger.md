Dropbox is a service to upload your files directly from your pc, without any browser. It syncs automatically, and is very useful, especially for Geeks, bloggers, and budding Coders and Designers. Here are 5 reasons why. 

- **Sync Source Codes and PSD files.** Very helpful while travelling, or if going somewhere. You can start doing stuff asap.
- **Share your folders with others, Sync Projects!** Still stuck with emails? How Old fashoined. Just right click on the folder, dropbox &gt; share folders with other &gt; enter email &gt; done! Do work productively. Done once with [Aditya Garg](http://unsane42.blogspot.com/)…
- **Instantly upload captured screenshots.** Once you get a screenshot of your screen, save it directly to dropbox’ public folder, or Pictures folder. Right Click &gt; Dropbox &gt; Copy Public link and share away, or put in your blog.
- **Backup your Blog.** Whether using Blogger or WordPress, backup your blog using dropbox. A copy will be online, in case you lose your blog, and your hard drive was stolen by a highly trained group of monkeys.
- **Sync your music.** Although there are better services, but, you can always sync your music with dropbox, and listen to it on your mobile later.

That was it. If you aren’t on dropbox yet, [sign up now](http://db.tt/JazFP0Jo)!
