Recently, I started putting codes in my blog posts. At start, It didnâ€™t work, and the code rendered in the blog post. I started looking for a solution, which allows to enter code in blogger posts and works easily. 

- Go to [Simplecode](http://www.simplebits.com/cgi-bin/simplecode.pl)
- Paste the code
- Copy the resulting code.

Done! Now, just copy paste all of it into a post, and you can show code to your readers.
