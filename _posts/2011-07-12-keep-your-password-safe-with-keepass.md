Hello Again, Readers.  
So, today, I saw that most of my passwords were more or less same.  
When I was a kid, it didn’t matter much as I did not have many ID’s.  
But now, when I have a lot of them, I have all of them the same!!  
When searching for a safe password, I saw that it is very fatal to keep all the passwords same.  
So I started changing them according to the most basic password making rules –

- Choose a base phrase
- Base phrase means a small sentence which you will remember. For eg, the first sentence of your favourite song, or your favourite book, or a personal sentence. Like, mine is
- I Walk a Lonely Road, The only Road I Have Ever Known.
- Then, take all of the first letters, and punctuation marks too. I’ll take **I W**alk **a L**onely **R**oad**, T**he **o**nly **R**oad **I H**ave **E**ver **K**nown**.** , making the phrase into a word, **IWaLR,ToRIHEK.**
- Sounds confusing, right? but there is more. Because, if you enter this password on multiple sites, **once a forum ID or a game ID is hacked, your BANK ID will follow**.
- So, what you have to do is add the name of the Website to your passwords. For eg, if I choose this as my Gmail password, I’ll add Gmail or Gma or something like that to the start or the end, to make it IWaLR,ToRIHEK.Gma .
- Now, your password is done! Enjoy and Be safe!

Now, you will ask, what is this called ‘KeePass’ which i have mentioned in the beginning of the post.IMHO, it is a very good password managing software. It makes a encrypted file, and then you can upload it anywhere. It is very safe, and you should use it in my opinion. Download it at [KeePass](http://keepass.info/) .
