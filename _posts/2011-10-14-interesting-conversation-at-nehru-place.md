Today, Finally, after asking my dad for stuff, he decided to take me to Nehru Place.
  

Let’s start with the start. 
  

Today, I had FIITJEE staybacks (they suck!) and, my dad didn’t know I’ve been staying back. Couldn’t call him too. So, I decided to go to a friend’s house. 
Chilled there till 5:30, when dad finally came. On the way home, I spotted the Delhi-IT-Hotspot : Nehru Place. and, I asked him, and he allowed to go 😀
  

There, he got some photocopies and printouts (he’s an architect you know), after that, we were just exploring. I hit upon a shop selling random stuff, and I remembered I need to buy a keyboard, and a Flash drive (lost my old one, why are they so small? :P)
  

So, after stumbling upon many shops, I finally got one that had all the stuff. Bagged a Gaming keyboard, and a Flash drive. Dad wanted one too, and he asked me “HP or Sandisk?”

I said- 

> “Ofcourse Sandisk. HP transfer speeds are WAYYYY slower (atleast in my experience).”

And upon hearing that, the sell-anything-by-saying-its-awesome salesman popped up. He took a look at the cover and exclaimed –
  


> “Sirji FLASH drive hai dekho likha hai. Nayi technology hai, achchi speed hai. Aur dikhne main bhi acchi hai”

I couldn’t resist a laugh 😀
