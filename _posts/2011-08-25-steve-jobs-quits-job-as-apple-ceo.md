Steve Jobs has quit as the CEO of Apple.  
Yes, he quit. A **direct quote he said**   
  
  
CUPERTINO, California – To the Apple Board of Directors and the Apple Community: “I have always said if there ever came a day when I could no longer meet my duties and expectations as Apple’s CEO, I would be the first to let you know. Unfortunately, that day has come. 

I hereby resign as CEO of Apple. I would like to serve, if the Board sees fit, as Chairman of the Board, director and Apple employee. 

As far as my successor goes, I strongly recommend that we execute our succession plan and name Tim Cook as CEO of Apple. 

I believe Apple’s brightest and most innovative days are ahead of it. And I look forward to watching and contributing to its success in a new role. 

I have made some of the best friends of my life at Apple, and I thank you all for the many years of being able to work alongside you. “

  
  
  
**Why you ask?…**  
  
 Well, if you know, he has ill health recently. He hasa rare form of pancreatic cancer. He survived from it once, but now its coming back.  
Due to work, he doesn’t get time for treatments.  
  
  
Now, Tim Cook is the CEO of Apple.   
  
  
It is said that Steve Jobs is the ‘Driving Force’ of Apple, as he revolutionized the iPad, iPhone and the iPod.   
  
  
This has caused the Stock prices of apple to go down a 4% (and more, but its 4 at the time of writing) from Tuesday, the day he quit.   
  
  
I’m not much of a Apple fanboy, but it’s still sad.
