Hello my friends!  
So, long time no see, huh?  
So, as you might have heard the news, Google + , the latest social networking project by Google is now out.  
Though it is only available in field trial (Google’s way of saying beta testing) and ID’s can be created by invite  
only, one of my friend, Tanay, sent me an invite. Check out his blog sometime [Taaazz’s Tech](http://techtaaazz.blogspot.com/) .  
So, back to the topic. I was saying, that i got into [G](http://plus.google.com/)[oogle +](http://google.com/plus).
