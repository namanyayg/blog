Finallyâ€¦ Got the opportunity to get into CW. Story time now.

\*\*\*\* start dialogs, \*\*\*\* end it. All narration is done by a helpful electron who can speak. You can call him rocky, though, certainly, it is not his name ( *Wink Wink* @[Pulkit Bhaiya](http://pulkit.me/))

I was sitting in Library, Reading Horrible Histories : Egypt peacefully. Aditya (Garg) enters, along with tanay and a bhaiya whom I do not know.

\*\*\*\*
*Aditya: Chal Naman, jaldi aa.*   
*Me : Kya hua re?*  
*Aditya: Kal quizzing karega?*  
*Me: (Sense of wierdness, and a chill in the spine) Of course re! Kahan?*  
*Aditya: Chal tu bas*  
\*\*\*\*\*

Aditya takes pange with library maâ€™am, and they are off  

\*\*\*\*
*Me: Kahan kaise kyun kab?*  
*Aditya: Yeh sab chod, ladkiyan dekhne chalna hai?*  
*Me: Ab tum itna force kar hi rahe ho toâ€¦*   
\*\*\*\*

They reach computer lab. Sadly, without a trace of a female homo sapien sapien. Luckily, Naman is happy seeing Xzhibit there.

\*\*\*\*
*\*Xzhibit, bhaiya, and tanay discuss, suddenly\**  
*Xzhibit: Photoshop karega tanay?*  
*\*Aditya pushes me in front of him\**  
*Xzhibit: Achcha, tu karega?*  
*Me: (stammering, forgetting how to speak. Luckily, pants still dry) Umm haanâ€¦*  
*Xzhibit: \*Tells details and stuff\* Ok kal aajayio.*   
*\*Shakes hand\**  
*Me: Ok sure.*   
\*\*\*\*

They leave computer lab. Outside,  

\*\*\*\*
*Me: That was the best thing ever. \*Looks at his hand with awe\**  
*Tanay: Hehe.*
\*\*\*\*

They discuss what will happen and what will not

\*\*\*\*
*Tanay: Oye tu saara kaam karliyo, mein to aise hi aa gaya hoon*  
*Me: Arre tu kuch to kar!! Achcha blending/filters seekh le!*  
*Tanay: Mera competition hai tera?! Code warriors mein kise aana hai, mujhe ya tujhe!*  
*Me: (\*Thinking he has a valid point, and still, I could do both \*) Arre kuch to karle plzzz!!!*  
\*\*\*\*

End of Line. Naman goes to class, shows off. Runs a few rounds coz of adrenaline rush.

\*\*\*\*

**Update: Naman hasnâ€™t done filters. Done renders and noise only. He is hoping that his competitors would be n00bs.**

Electrons were with me that day ðŸ˜‰
