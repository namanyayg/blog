Hiya Guys!  
  
  
Today, i’m going to inform you about the Razer Tiamat 7.1 in more detail, so that you know what you are winning.  
Direct Quote from the [Info Page](http://www.razerzone.com/tiamat/en)> “Behold the Razer Tiamat 7.1, the world’s first circumaural gaming headset with 10 individual drivers built-in to deliver the ultimate 7.1 Surround Sound experience. Dominate deathmatches when you can hear incoming enemy footsteps to prevent backstabs and pinpoint enemy locations through gunfire with absolute precision.”

You must be wondering, that what the 10 drivers mean. To put it simply, the 10 drivers create a ‘Real Surround Sound’. These days, most headsets have a virtual surround sound experience, which uses formulas to create an impression of depth and distance.   
  
  
But Real Surround Sound Acts just like there are 5 speakers and a subwoofer in the room, just like a home theater. This Real Surround Sound Helps in Gaming a lot, and is a lot better than the standard headsets. Register now, as the contest is only till 22nd august.
