**EDIT! FIRST FEW INVITES WITH LESS CONDITIONS!**
  

You Must have heard of Unthink. Especially if you are a techie. Unthink is the mix between Google Plus, Facebook and Myspace, all in the Pros, and not the Cons. It offers full control over your profile. You can choose an advertiser to â€˜sponserâ€™ you. Unthinkâ€™s privacy controls are also easy to use. **And Iâ€™m going to invite you in ðŸ˜€**


Unthink believes to make your life easier and simpler, and isnâ€™t just the Facebook Killer, itâ€™s aiming to kill LinkedIn as well.. 
  

[![](http://www.unthink.com/images/logo_glow.png)](http://www.unthink.com/images/logo_glow.png)It features 4 different streams at one place, so you donâ€™t have to switch everytime like you do on Google Plus and Facebook. 
  

Unthink also emphasizes to read the privacy policy and itâ€™s the first to offer a special â€˜Deedâ€™ of ownership, where it calls itself as â€˜Grantorâ€™, you the â€˜Granteeâ€™ and your space in unthink as your â€˜suiteâ€™ 
  

Then you have to choose your sponsor. It is so that all your profile isnâ€™t cluttered with ads, and people at Unthink can maintain it. I was given Unthink as the sponsor, because â€˜there wasnâ€™t one availableâ€™. Seems Legit.
  

You can now invite your friends from Gmail, Yahoo and others. Ofcourse it didnâ€™t find any contacts on my Gmail -.-
  

You have the choice of importing EVERYTHING from facebook. This is known as the â€˜Emancipation Suitcaseâ€™
  

The Default privacy setting of your profile is visible only to you, so you will need to change that. Then, you will become the â€˜ownerâ€™ of your place on Unthink. Enjoy. 
  

But, before that, **you will need an invite. Which I have. Unlimited Invites Giveaway!!!**
