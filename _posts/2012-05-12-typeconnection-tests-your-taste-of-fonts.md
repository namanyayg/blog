Do you think of yourself an expert in fonts? Or, do you feel that you have a lot to improve on pairing fonts? TypeConnection does exactly this. It makes font testing a “game” and gets the user to make the best paired fonts go on a date. A fun concept, with great value for designers.

> “Start by choosing a typeface to pair. Like a conventional dating website, Type Connection presents you with potential “dates” for each main character— without the misleading profile photos and commitment-phobes. The game features well-known, workhorse typefaces and portrays each as a character searching for love. You are the matchmaker. You decide what kind of match to look for by choosing among several strategies for combining typefaces. Along the way, you explore typographic terminology, type history, and more. By playing Type Connection, you deepen your own connection with type.”

TypeConnection first asks you for a main character to choose. Afterwards, it presents you with “strategies” to choose a paired font for it. (All, which is accompanied by humorous descriptions and hovers)

Once you choose a strategy, and then a font, you’re presented with the key points of each font. This part can really make you familiar with the technical terms. You can change the font by the check box at the top.

Afterwards, you, send the two fonts to a blind date, and you get a result whether they are a match, or not.

*(PS. I got 5/5 on sending people on dates. Either I’m good at relationships, or design)*
