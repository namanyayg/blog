Just checked Facebook, and saw that I had 6 messages‚Ä¶ I do not always have such a large unread message box, so I checked. All messages had ‚ÄúYukky‚Äù or ‚ÄúMakes me Sick lol‚Äù with an attachment‚Ä¶ Decided to check out the attachment, and, turns out, that it was another Facebook Spam Trick‚Ä¶ **EDIT: Learnt How it Works! Read it Below!**

I didn‚Äôt follow these steps, or else I would have gotten the script. If any of your friend does this, reply back to him, and if he wants proof, Just link him to this page üòâ

**What Happens?**  
  
  
If you follow the steps, what will happen, is that your computer will restart. When you restart, and go to Facebook again, you will be redirected to a fake facebook login page (phishing page). Once you enter your ID and pass there, you are gone.

**What to do if I accidently clicked the link, and followed the steps?**  
  
  
First of all, it doesn‚Äôt matter if you only click the link, and go away. If you don‚Äôt follow the steps, nothing happens. However, **if you do follow the steps,**  your ID is in critical danger. Your Login Details are in the hands of a cracker.

As you are being redirected to a phishing page, the best thing to do is to check the URL and login only on the official facebook page. If it is too late, **change your password ASAP!**  
  
  
I recommend you to spread awareness, and spread this post, along with more proof if you find on the internet, to spread awareness, and to stop your friend‚Äôs ID‚Äôs being comromised
