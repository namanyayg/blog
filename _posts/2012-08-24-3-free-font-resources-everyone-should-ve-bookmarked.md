Fonts, fonts, fonts. It seems you can *never have plenty*.

These days, the popularity of free fonts is rising, and there seem to be more and more of free fonts. With the increase in number of free fonts, we also see an increase in the number of font resource websites. Here are three beautiful websites, which have fonts, free for you to download.

### 3. League of Movable Type

[League of movable type](http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/), made in 2009, feature a lot of fonts, for print and web. Mostly, their fonts are focused *on print*, not for the web. You’ll find some really good fonts here, and very artistic and unique ones.

**What I like –**

- The league’s design. Clear, crisp.
- It’s font pages. Each page has two main links, one to github and one to download. Each page also features a slier, which shows the font used in different scenarios.

**What I dislike –**

- The typography on their website. It’s not readable, at all. Their current font size isn’t legible on my screen.
- The fonts’ featured image. Usually, it’s just the name of the font. I’d like to see all the glyphs of a font in one place.

###  2. Font Squirrel

[Font Squirrel](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/) provides ‘100% free (fonts) for commercial use’.

**What I like –**

- Their font-face generator. It’s a bit [tough understanding](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/blog/2010/12/how-to-use-the-generator) it, but really helpful.
- Their ‘Popular’ and ‘Recent’ pages. Useful when you’re looking for a font, but don’t know exactly what it’s supposed to be.
- ‘Test Drive’ under a font. It takes text, and gives it in the selected font.
- ‘Character Map’ under a font. Shows all glyphs for a font.

**What I dislike –**

- They (sometimes) link the download externally. This may lead to a download being paid *(example [Museo Slab](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Museo-Slab))*
- Their heading font. I find it unprofessional and awkward.

### 1. Google Webfonts

[Google Webfonts](http://www.google.com/webfonts). Simply the best free resource for embedding fonts online. Also, **OPEN SOURCE FONTS**! Yay!

**What I like –**

- Collections. You can simply gather all of your chosen fonts at one place, then download/embed it.
- Fonts are provided by Google CDN, ensuring high download speeds to a visitor’s PC.
- Allows to choose different methods of importing fonts.
- Great search and categorization.
- Can change preview text for each font.
- Fonts are available in different scripts.

**What I dislike –**

- The ‘Collections’ part in the bottom takes *too* much of real estate.
- In the ‘review’ page of a collection, body copy doesn’t go above 14px, *even though the recommended is 16px.*

### Conclusion

Each resource has a different use, but broadly, you should use The League for graphics, FontSquirrel for getting the name for new fonts, and graphics, and Google Webfonts for web usage.
