Hiya Guys! This is the page to comment if you want your photos to be edited. to get your edits, you can post me the link and your requirements through the comments section. To upload a photo and send it to me, got to [Uploading.com](http://uploading.com/), where you have to click the ‘browse’ button next to the box, and choose the pic. Then, after it is uploaded, copy and paste the download link and comment it.
