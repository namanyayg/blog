Hello Guys! You know, I have been practicing hard for the upcoming Code Warriors Intra. For that, I thought i had a good chance at DI , or Digital Imaging. But when I saw that WebD (Website Designing) and DI go together, I was worried. I came to know that DI was not much independently. So, I made it my aim to learn WebD. And the most surprising and cool part, I made this aim yesterday, and now Iâ€™m done! All thanks to the help of Dreamweaver, and the invention of WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get). So. What is WYSIWYG? WYSIWYG is a environment in which what you do is shown in GUI (Hence WYS) and what you are shown is the end product (Hence WYG) As it is GUI , it is very easy and can be learned quickly. A software that uses WYSIWYG is Adobe Dreamweaver. Dreamweaver helped me a lot, and is very good. Iâ€™ll be posting the tutorials later. Right now, I am super tired. been working from 2:30 am. Goodbye readers, Iâ€™m gonna make myself a light snack ðŸ™‚
