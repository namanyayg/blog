Back to the topic now guys.. 
If you have heard about screen recorders, Hypercam comes to mind. But, Personally, I dont like it very much. IMHO, one of the best screen recorders is

**Areas it excelled :** 

- **Nice Look â€“** Camtasia Has a sleek design and a Vista-ish look, with the base green
- **Easy to start and record â€“** It would be impossible for anyone to have a problem with recording! Hotkeys are also there!
- **Built in editing â€“** You donâ€™t need to have another video editing software if you have camtasia!

**Areas it was -meh- :**

- **Heavy â€“** Takes too much power
- **Has itâ€™s own file type â€“** Raw recordings are with the extension .camrec, and you canâ€™t (obviously) straight away upload. You need to first â€˜Produceâ€™ it with Camtasia, which can take some time. 


Fraps â€“ Best Screen Recorder For Gamers

Ever had a time that you HAD TO record a video walkthrough, but mainstream recorders made your fps higher and gave you lag? Worry No more! Fraps is one screen recorder specially mad for recording games.

**Areas it excelled :** 

- **Toooo Good for Gaming screen recordings â€“** Best software if you want to create a video tutorial/Walkthrough. For example, [this video walkthrough was created through fraps](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UkE99OT-yU).
- **Easy to use â€“** I mean, you canâ€™t go wrong when you have to double-click a icon and press a key!

**Areas it was -meh- :**

- **Looks â€“** Not best in the looks department..
- **No clear Indicator of recording or not â€“** This one really sucked. I had problems with fraps first few times just because of this.
- **Can take up lot of space, quickly â€“** It streams recordings to your hardrive live time. Can take up too much space (one of my 2 minute vidues took space  3 gb)
- **Exports in .Avi â€“** Better than a custom extension though. 

So guys, this was it. The start of many posts to come. Live long and Prosper.
