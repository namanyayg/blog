Another of the facebook spams…  
Recently, I got a notification that a friend had tagged me. There was a link to a video in that. But, I knew it was another spam, and so, here is a spam bust to save you guys from it. 

### How does it look like?

The video link said “**A young boy get STABBED By CRAZED alcoholic Outside N.Y.C. NightClub In christmas Eve!”**
Here is a pic for you.

What Happens?

Once you click the link, you will be redirected to a page. You will have to like that page.

Once you do so, you will be shown a youtube like video. If you click play, you will be shown that the video has been age restricted, and you have to click a button “I am 18+” to pass.

Once you type it in, and press enter, this spam will be posted to all your friends’s walls!


After That

After that, you have to fill a survey for that. Ofcourse I didn’t do that!


Tricker’s Intelligence

The spammer was quite smart! Here are some tricks he used to make it look as authentic as possible.

- He used an official looking youtube layout for the video
- He included the idea of telling users to add a “j”
- The comments there are not actually for the spam! They are for something else, and the tricker used it, so that users think the spam is authentic.

Hope you are saved from the spam! Tell me, did it help?
