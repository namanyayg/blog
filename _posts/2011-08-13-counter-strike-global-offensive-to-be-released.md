Hiya Guys!  
You read that right.  
  
  
Valve is releasing a new game, Counter Strike : Global Offensive.  
It runs on the UPDATED Source engine, and is meant to be like the ‘sequel’ of Counter Strike 1.6  
  
  
Here is a **direct quote** –   
  
> “Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS: GO) will expand upon the team-based action gameplay that it pioneered when it was launched 12 years ago.

> CS: GO features new maps, characters, and weapons and delivers updated versions of the classic CS content (de\_dust, etc.). In addition, CS: GO will introduce new gameplay modes, matchmaking, leader boards, and more.

> “Counter-Strike took the gaming industry by surprise when the unlikely MOD became the most played online PC action game in the world almost immediately after its release in August 1999,” said Doug Lombardi at Valve. “For the past 12 years, it has continued to be one of the most-played games in the world, headline competitive gaming tournaments and selling over 25 million units worldwide across the franchise. CS: GO promises to expand on CS’ award-winning gameplay and deliver it to gamers on the PC as well as the next gen consoles and the Mac.”

> CS: GO is being developed by Valve in cooperation with Seattle-based Hidden Path Entertainment. The title is targeted for release in early 2012 and will be playable at this year’s PAX Prime and Eurogamer Expo.”

**Other Platforms –**   
  
  
It will be released for the Xbox 360 and PS3 also. This Game is in pre-beta stage currently. It is tested by  Craig “Torbull” Levine. Torbull says, that now Valve is kinda ‘equalizing’ the guns, which means, that they are making all the guns equal, and with their own advantages and disadvantages, so that the M4 , AK47, Deagle and AWP do not rule anymore. According to him, the new models look better, there are more smoother graphics and animations, and the guns look better too.  
  
  
  
  
**New Weapons –**  
  
  
Currently, two more weapons are known to be released, one which is the   
  
  
Molotov cocktail, priced $850. They currently are stackable, and they bounce. Torbull says that this needs to be revised.  
  
  
Other is the ‘Decoy Grenade’. They are used to emit gun sounds, so opponents feel that there is a actual player standing there. Currently, when thrown by terrorist, the play the sound of AK and Glock, and when thrown by CT , they play the sound of M$ and USP.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
**Conclusion**  
  
  
He says that it doesnt feel like CS: Source, and it doesn’t even feel like Cs 1.6 ! Valve says that they may change something on the official release, so the above may not be in the actual game. Comment and tell your opinions.
