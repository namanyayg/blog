If someone is on Blogger, and has copied your content, and is 1. Not willing to remove it OR 2. Not willing to give credits

You’ll then have to use Legal action.   
This process is greatly simplified by Google. You just have to go to 
it’s[ page to report Copyright Infringement ](http://www.google.com/support/bin/request.py?contact_type=lr_dmca&product=blogger) 

Then you give the

- Original Work Proof
- Description of Original Work
- Blogger Blog that has copied your Work

You will receive a email, and after that, you are done.   

In a week or two, Google will take action against that person. His ID’s may get blocked, and he may be stopped from using further services from Google. After all, copying is not a good thing, is it?  
Though, keep in mind, Google is not particularly favorable towards false reports, and, you may have to pay fees for damages. You can see it on the [report a Copyright Infringement page](http://www.google.com/support/bin/request.py?contact_type=lr_dmca&product=blogger)

IMPORTANT: Misrepresentations made in your notice regarding whether material or activity is infringing may expose you to liability for damages (including costs and attorneys’ fees). [Courts have found](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2209471029398314909) that you must consider copyright defenses, limitations or exceptions before sending a notice. In [one case](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9280842894530460095) involving online content, a company paid more than $100,000 in costs and attorneys fees after targeting content protected by the U.S. fair use doctrine. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material available online infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.

Now go and retrieve your stolen content, but don’t forget to thank me!
