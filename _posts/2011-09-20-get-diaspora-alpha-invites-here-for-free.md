You must have already know that I have started Giveaways, first one being [Google Plus Invite Giveaway.](http://create-n.blogspot.com/2011/08/get-free-google-plus-invites-here.html)
  

Now, this is the invite to the newest Social Network, DIASPORA\*ALPHA, also called DIASPORA\* or even the simple Diaspora. 
  

So.. lets start with some of the features. DIASPORA\* is focused on privacy.
  
> Diaspora makes sharing clean and easy – and this goes for privacy too. Inherently private, Diaspora doesn’t make you wade through pages of settings and options just to keep your profile secure.

As it clearly states, it is very easy to remain private on DIASPORA\*.
  

Also, its creators say that the Google Plus’ Circles feature was inspired by DIASPORA\* . D\* also has a feature like circles, known as ‘aspects’.
  


> Diaspora lets you sort your connections into groups called aspects. Unique to Diaspora, aspects ensure that your photos, stories and jokes are shared only with the people you intend.

  

In looks too, D\* is like G+, but with black and grey instead of green and orange. 
And, one more thing common is that, it is also **invite only.**
