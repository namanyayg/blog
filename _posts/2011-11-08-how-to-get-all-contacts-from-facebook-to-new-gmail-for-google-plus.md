If you want to switch to Google Plus, one problem is that you may not have managed your Gmail Contact List, or maybe you didnâ€™t have all your friends in your contacts. 
  

Letâ€™s say that you have to ask all your friends to come from Facebook to Google Plus. Not an easy task without email IDâ€™s, amrite? So hereâ€™s an easy way to get all your Facebook contacts to Gmail. 


For this, you must have a 13+ age entered Yahoo ID, if not, [register for one](https://edit.yahoo.com/registration?.intl=in&.src=ym&.done=http://in.mail.yahoo.com/), then follow the steps. 
\[*Note: We are assuming that you have the latest yahoo interface\]*

- Click on â€˜Contactsâ€™ Tab
- Click on the â€˜Import Contactsâ€™ button in the right frame.

- Click OK when it asks your permission to share contacts. 

After this, you are done *if you wanted contacts only for yahoo.* Keep Reading **if you want your contacts in Gmail**. In Gmail too, the steps are with the latest interface \[Though there wonâ€™t be much of a difference\]  
- Go Back to your â€˜Contactsâ€™ Tab.
- In the Tools/Actions dropdown (depending whether you have the new interface or the old one) choose â€˜Exportâ€¦â€™
- Click â€˜Export Nowâ€™ In front of **Yahoo CSV.**
- Save to a preferred location (for simplicity, lets assume you saved on your desktop)

This gets your contacts on your hard drive. Now, you have to import them to Gmail. - Login to your Gmail ID. 
- Click on â€˜Mailâ€™ from top left, and choose contacts.

- From the pop up box, click on â€˜Choose Fileâ€™ and choose the CSV you just saved. 
- Watch as your contacts are synced. Then, invite all your friends on Google Plus ðŸ™‚
