The Actual Post Goes as follows (don‚Äôt start Copy Pasting to Facebook, This is not real!!!) ‚Äì


> A girl meets a boy on her yahoo messenger:
>   
> crazy1 86: hey baby!!!
>   
> h0tNsPiCy91: who is this??? crazy1 86: ur secret admirer!!!!!
> ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶

> 
> crazy1 86:dont worry‚Ä¶. ill take very good care of you‚Ä¶
> 
> crazy1 86 had signed off.
> 
> The girl was so scared she locked all her doors and windows. She made sure her room was secured. She wasn‚Äôt sure if it was a joke or for real. She didn‚Äôt know when he was going to come. The girl was so frightened she decided to sleep with her little sister. The girl dozed off quickly.
> 
> Then she heard a knock on the window. The girl slowly walked to the window. It started knocking louder. The girl looked through the windows and saw nothing‚Ä¶ just some of the tree branches. The girl went back to bed with her sister. The bed was wet and had a pretty horrid smell. Maybe her sister wet the bed‚Ä¶ the girl checked and found blood everywhere. The girl panicked. She didn‚Äôt know what to do. She ran and hid in the closet in case the killer was there for her. While looking through the cracks of the closet the girl saw a shadow. It was dark, so she couldn‚Äôt figure out who it was. She started to get more frightened. The shadow crept closer to the closet. The girl closed her eyes as if it was a dream. Then suddenly he opened the closet door and pulled her out.
> 
> Her parents found her dead the next morning. She was completely skinned and hanging in her sister‚Äôs closet. The younger sister was also found skinned and dead.
> 
> PART 2‚Ä¶
> 
> Two years after the Smith sisters deaths, the parents had a baby boy. The girl‚Äôs room became a guest room and the little sister‚Äôs room where the murder took place became the baby‚Äôs room. The baby grew up to be a successful kid.
> 
> One night he was on the computer and received an instant messege.
> 
> h0tNsPiCy91: Hey lil bro!!!
> 
> 2seXay4u: Who is this?
> 
> h0tNsPiCy91: It‚Äôs your big sis.
> 
> 2seXay4u: I never had a sister. I‚Äôm an only child.
> 
> 2seXay4u: This is some kinda joke, huh?
> 
> h0tNsPiCy91: Mom and dad never told you?
> 
> h0tNsPiCy91: I died 15 years ago with your other older sister.
> 
> h0tNsPiCy91: We were murdered in your room which was once my little sister‚Äôs room. She was killed in bed when I was sleeping. I was killed in the closet and skinned to death.
> 
> 2seXay4u: Quit lying. I never had a sister. If I did my parents would have told me. Whatever. Your stupid.
> 
> h0tNsPiCy91: You don‚Äôt believe me? Well if you wanna look in your closet floor.
> 
> h0tNsPiCy91: I carved my name and the time and date I was being murdered. Then I carved my little sister‚Äôs name.
> 
> h0tNsPiCy91: If you don‚Äôt believe me little brother check the internet. Google on ‚ÄùSmith sisters murdered anonymousl y‚Äù.
> 
> h0tNsPiCy91: I gtg little brother. I love you and mom and dad soo much. I can‚Äôt believe they kept us a secret from you. They should burn in hell.
> 
> The boy checked the closet. He saw the carvings. Was it true? He surfed the internet and information was there about the anonymous murder in the house. The next morning the boy went downstairs. It was so quiet. Maybe his parents were sleeping. Hours later the boy found his parents in their closet skinned and hung. Then he found more carvings on the ground. They said ‚ÄùI TOLD YOU I WASN‚ÄôT LYING LITTLE BROTHER, I LOVED MOM AND DAD‚Ä¶. BUT THEY KEPT ME A SECRET. I CAN‚ÄôT BELIEVE IT. WELL I‚ÄôM FREE FROM THIS COLD WORLD, I WON‚ÄôT HURT YOU LIKE I HURT THEM. I LOVE YOU!‚Äù

> ‚Äì LISA SMITH
> 
> This is a death chain letter. If you don‚Äôt repost this in the next hour, the parents will kill you at night. They will kill you!
> 
> DONT BELEIVE ME? LOOK IT UP IN GOOGLE! :O üòÄ

This Spam is spreading more than [Google](http://create-n.blogspot.com/search/label/Google) did (not literally, of course!). You guys would be surprised to know that spam message has been from 2005. Ya right, 2005. You oldies üòõ
  

and, if you search it up on google, you will find mythbusters only. The best site with proof I found was [Snope‚Äôs Smith Sisters Skinned Flick](http://www.snopes.com/horrors/ghosts/skinned.asp). There you would find all the proof that the above is a spam.
