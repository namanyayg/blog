Hiya Guys!  
  
  
Yep, you read that right. Google Plus, the latest Social Network, has released Games!  
Currently, it features only a few Games, including Angry Birds, Bejeweled, and Zynga Poker.   
  
  
Zynga Poker ?? Yes, it has released Zynga Poker too.. now, Facebook is not the only one with Zynga!….  
  
  
  
Here is a Direct Quote –  
  
> “My family has a games closet. Inside you’ll find a few decks of cards, two decades’ worth of board games and a Twister mat for those times when we’re feeling limber. Playing games is a great way for us to spend quality time with each other (and a little healthy competition never hurt anyone either).Today we’re adding games to Google+. With the [Google+ project](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/06/introducing-google-project-real-life.html), we want to bring the nuance and richness of real-life sharing to the web. But sharing is about more than just conversations. The experiences we have together are just as important to our relationships. We want to make playing games online just as fun, and just as meaningful, as playing in real life.“

  
  
 Here is a picture so you know better –

You may or may not be able to play games, as Google+ Developers say that they are going slowly rolling out the games, but they will be available to you soon.   
  


> “Today we’re starting to gradually roll out games in Google+. We look forward to making them fully available to everyone in Google+ soon. When you see a Games page in your account, please give games a try and send us feedback. Look for the “send feedback” button in the bottom right-hand corner of any page in Google+. Thanks for playing! Like the [rest of the Google+ project](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F%2B%2Flearnmore%2F), we’re just getting started. “

  
  
So, now, there is another reason to switch to [Google+ ](http://google.com/plus)  
  
  
Be sure to tell in the comments if you have already gotten games!
