If you are on Blogger, you know it is a trouble to maintain a new profile for blogger. 
Now, you can switch to your G+ profile instead of Blogger‚Äôs!
  

It is easy making the switch.

Just go to [draft.blogger.com](http://draft.blogger.com/) and click on the promotional message. (If the message is not coming, or, you messed up, you can [direclty switch to Google Plus](http://draft.blogger.com/switch-profile.g))
  

Once you are there, read the Conditions, and then proceed to the switch. The conditions have been given below ‚Äì 
  
> ‚ÄúYour public Google+ profile will replace your Blogger profile
> Your profile gadget will show information, including your common name, from your public Google+ profile instead of your Blogger profile
> Your posts and comments will link to your public Google+ profile
> This change will affect all your blogs: \[Your Blog(s) here\]
> IMPORTANT NOTES
> Upon switching to your Google+ profile, you will have the option of reverting back to your Blogger profile for 30 days. After that, your Blogger profile data will be deleted.Information on your Blogger profile won‚Äôt be transferred to your Google+ profile, so copy your Blogger profile information to your Google+ profile before switching‚Äù

  

Oh and if you do not have a G+ id, [register for one](https://plus.google.com/), or, don‚Äôt use the new one at all. It is optional üòâ 
  

Another Great thing about this is, after allowing the switch, you are asked if you want to be listed as contributer to your Blog(s) on your Google Plus profile. Do check that step, as, it may convert to traffic‚Ä¶

[](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tgNVCpa9ZwY/TqlNZVvIn1I/AAAAAAAAAZU/EQ6Iv0aImV0/s1600/G_plus_Contributer_To.png)Oh and if you are one of those people who don‚Äôt like this, you [can revert to your blogger profile back within 30 days](http://www.blogger.com/revert-profile.g). After 30 days, all your data will be deleted.   
I am going to keep the G+ profile‚Ä¶ What about you?
