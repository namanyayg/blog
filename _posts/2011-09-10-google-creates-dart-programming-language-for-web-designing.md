At the **GOTO developers conference in October**, Google plans to provide details about a newly created programming language. But the question is, will anyone use it? 
  


What we know – 


The news we got is that two people – **Gilad Bracha**, a veteran of SAP, Sun, and the co-author of Java and **Lars Bak**, the creator of Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine, is the other one who will tell about Dart at the GOTO conference. They are thought to be the developers of the langauge too. 




How do we know that –

It all started when Google began buying ‘**Dart’ related Domain names**. Upon further searching, it was found out that it was due to a realease of a new programming language, dart.
  




About Dart –

We already know that it won’t be C related, as Google has already released on, Go. It is thought that Dart would be a competition to JavaScript and Python. And it is also thought that it will be specialize in ‘Google-only’ Issues, but it may have a use for us outsiders as well, though this is not sure, as google has not ‘officialy’ released information about it, but we have got to know about it by reading [Bracha’s Blogs](http://gbracha.blogspot.com/), and Interpreting some hints.
