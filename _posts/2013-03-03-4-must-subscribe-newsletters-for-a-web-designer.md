To stay at the top of our fields, us web designers have to be up-to-date to everything that’s going on in the design and development world. One easy way to keep informed about everything is to subscribe to newsletters, whether weekly or daily, and get articles straight to your email.

## Sidebar

[Sidebar](http://sidebar.io/) is definitely one of the top newsletters in the design world. Curated by [Sacha Greif](https://twitter.com/SachaGreif), it delivers 5 best links of the day, straight to your email.

## UX Weekly

[UX Weekly](http://uxwkly.com)—Another favorite of mine. This one would definitely be the first, if only it was as frequent as Sidebar. Curated by [Simon](https://twitter.com/simonv3). As the title suggests, UX articles and tools, delivered every week.
