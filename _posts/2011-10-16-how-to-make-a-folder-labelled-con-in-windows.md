Recently, One of my readers challenged me to make a Folder Named ‘CON’ on windows. Of Course I had to accept.


If you are wondering what is the challenge in that, try and create a folder name CON. Can you?

| Created a Folder named con. MISSION ACCOMPLISHED! |

**Why Cannot You Create a Folder named CON?**

Actually, CON is one of the reserved folder names from the times of DOS. Con, and many others, including CON, PRN, AUX, CLOCK$, NUL, COM1, COM2, COM3, COM4, COM5, COM6, COM7, COM8, COM9, LPT1, LPT2, LPT3, LPT4, LPT5, LPT6, LPT7, LPT8, LPT9 are all reserved. Hence you cannot create them.


**How To Create CON Folder then?**

Creating a CON Folder is pretty easy. You just

- Make A Folder (On Desktop, C Drive, Anywhere)
- Rename it
- Press and Hold ‘ALT’ key, and at that time, press ‘255’ on the Numpad
- Type in Con.

You would see that the folder is made successfully

**How Does it Work?**

Actually, Typing in ALT+255 adds a ASCII key before the folder, which is not visible, and looks like a space. So Technically, we are not creating a folder named con. Other Variations Include –- Adding Alt+255 After Typing CON
- Typing ALT+1060 before/after typing CON

Another neat trick you can do is that type ALT+255/ALT+1060 before AND After the folder name. This will make CON Center Aligned, and it will not look like you have added a space.
