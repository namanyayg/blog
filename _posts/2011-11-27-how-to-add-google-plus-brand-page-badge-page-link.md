Recently, I made a page for [TechnoSane on Google Plus](https://plus.google.com/b/106605570716965400177/). There was a feature called Google Plus Badges, which are a nice way to increase followers on G+. In this post I will be giving you the code, and why is it useful for you. 

**Why It works**  
  
If you are looking for a way to increase your followers, The best way is a Badge, as it is a good visual and big way to show your page, much like Facebook’s Like Box.

That simple box results in much followers (Got 4 already!)

**The Code**  
  

You can [officially get the code easily](https://developers.google.com/+/plugins/badge/config). The only thing that may trouble you is the “Your Google Plus Page Link”  
This will help you find it.

(Mine says “1 page” your may have more, depending on the number of pages you have)
- See the URL. You will find a string of numbers. Copy That, for further use.

There, paste the link.

Scroll Down, and you will find the code.
