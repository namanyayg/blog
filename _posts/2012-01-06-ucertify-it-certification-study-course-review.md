**I have got a offer from uCertify to review their PrepKit and I have accepted that challenge and now I am reviewing [Adobe Photoshop 9A0-150](http://www.ucertify.com/search/search.php?q=photoshop+9a0-150) PrepKit from uCertify.**  


**First looks, I have to appreciate it’s design, and it’s neat interface. **  


On the top, one will find questions, which starts with a diagnostic test to determine initial skill. Then, it has 3 practice test, followed by a final test. 


**At the bottom, one will find study resources, which include, visual How-tos, articles, notes, and also tips and key terms. **  


The best thing I like about this is that it records all your progress with detailed information where you were wrong. You can access that anytime.
  
It also shows when you are ready to handle a task.


**As soon as I am done with the full review, I will post it for you all… **
