Hello Guys!  
  
  
If you are a Counter Strike player, you must be searching how to play with friends, multiplayer. WITHOUT STEAM  
  
  
One of the methods is to go to [Gametracker](http://www.gametracker.com/search/cs/) , and then copy and paste the ip into your console. For eg, the ip  
is xxx.xx.xxxx.x . Then, you will have to :  
  
  
  
  
1. Open up Counter strike 1.6
2. Go to console by pressing ` key. (Left to number one)
3. Entering in the Console, “connect xxx.xx.xxxx.x” (without quotes)
4. You will then connect to the server. (Note: This does not work on all servers)

As you’ve read, this method is not trust able, as it sometimes doesn’t work. So, what to do?What you need to do is first, [Download Tunngle](http://www.tunngle.net/index.php?l=en&pg=downloads).
