Hola Guys! Big news today.. you know, the PSN Network is back!!! w0000000tâ€¦ First, Iâ€™m gonna make a PSN ID , and then test a few features of itâ€¦Plz share your PSN IDâ€™s with me too, guys ðŸ˜€ (Although the procedure of making a ID is very annoying on PSP)

Unluckily, PSN Network is back only for North America, but, you can still create an ID.

Qriocity is not for India.. Maybe later, huh?

And as PSN is not available for our country this point of time, Digital Comics are also not available..Well.. atleast we get the joy of making a PSN ID huh? *forced smile*
