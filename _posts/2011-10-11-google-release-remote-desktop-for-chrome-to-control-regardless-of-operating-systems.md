*Article first published as [Google Releases Remote Desktop for Chrome](http://technorati.com/technology/it/article/google-releases-remote-desktop-for-chrome/) on Technorati.*  
  

The long awaited feature of Google Chrome is here. You can now control Desktops, remotely, and the best part, it is cross-platform.You just have to install the Chrome App, [Chrome Remote Desktop BETA](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gbchcmhmhahfdphkhkmpfmihenigjmpp)

See the emphasis on BETA. Google itself says that it is not free from glitches and bugs, and users may have problemsâ€¦ But, atleast it is cross platform and easy to install!!

You can forget about Teamviewer now ðŸ˜€

**How to use it â€“**
  
Using Google Remote Desktop is easy. You install it, you grab the share code, and give it to your friend/person who wants to remote control you.

If you are the controller, you just have to input the code given by the client. Easy right?

**Why Was it Made â€“**

It was made in mind that users often need help perfoming a particular task/ troubleshooting a problem, and this could be used to solve the issue.

It is also made to depict Google Chromeâ€™s core remote control features, and get feedback from users (as clearly stated on the download page)

**Pros and Cons-**

**Pros-**

- Googleâ€™s Trust
- Easy to use
- Cross Platform
- Nice looks

**Cons-**

- 19 mb file to download
- Still in Beta, may have glitches
