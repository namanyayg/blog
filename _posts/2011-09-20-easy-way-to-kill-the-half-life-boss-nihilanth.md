If you are a avid FPS/Sci Fi Player, you MUST have heard of Half-Life. It is a game developed by Valve, which features Gordon Freeman. Like most Sci Fi Shooters, we are invaded by aliens. [Check out its Description yourslef](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_(video_game))

So yeah. If you do play Half-Life, you would know that itâ€™s not a easy game for babies. But, ironically, the last level DOES have a baby (though its overgrown) and is easy. All that is explained in my latest walkthrough.

Check it out, and finish half-life !
