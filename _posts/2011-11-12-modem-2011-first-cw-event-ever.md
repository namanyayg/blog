Had my first CW event today – Modem 2011, in Modern School, Vasant Vihar. The place was a bore, with weird layout and paint choice. I was with Kartik. We went there in my car (We two live close by) and reached there quite early, at 7:30. Xzhibit had told us to be there by 8:00… in excitement, got there at 7:30.


Both strolled along for a quite long time, simply because there was nothing to do. Much later (8:15) Tanay came. Talked and discussed stuff. Registered ourselves.

Soon, Aditya (Garg) reached too. Registered him too.

Near 9:00, the rest of the group was here, along with Pallavi ma’am. All were discussing who goes in which event…

Amandeep was for GD, and Aditya for Quiz. Tanay for Photoshop (with me) and Nachiketa datt (bloodmountain) for gaming (game was HL2 Deathmatch) Others were at their respective places.

After some wait, I had my DI event… Tanay was off to escort Nachiketa, while I nervously followed the volunteer, remembered the way, rushed back to get Tanay.

Got a computer, and made a pretty <strike>ok</strike> lame image, on the topic of Video Game/Movie (click to enlarge):

Played games on each others cell instead.

Returned home, empty handed. Nothing for DPS Vk at Modem this time.
