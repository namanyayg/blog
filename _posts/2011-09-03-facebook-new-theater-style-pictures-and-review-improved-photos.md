In this Post I’ll Show you 1. The **new Theater style**
2. It’s **Features**
3. It’s **Pros and Cons**

Firstmost, the new Theater Style. Here is a Screenshot below (Click to Enlarge) (Names removed for Privacy) Oh and if you’re wondering where is this Image from, wait no further. [Fruit by Imrockinboy](http://create-n.blogspot.com/2011/07/photoshop-backgrounds-i-made-from.html)[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-o-38vw8F_IE/TmIPL6Iq8mI/AAAAAAAAAUM/mqTvs77jc5M/s320/PicPreviewNe_FB.png)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-o-38vw8F_IE/TmIPL6Iq8mI/AAAAAAAAAUM/mqTvs77jc5M/s1600/PicPreviewNe_FB.png)  

Like it? Can you remember something like this? Oh yeah, the style looks like [**Google+**](https://plus.google.com/) ! Cheater Facebook..
  

However, it looks good on Facebook, too.
  

**Changes and Features**
  

If you see, I’ve numbered the new features.
  

1) The ‘**Exit**‘ or ‘**Quit**‘ Sign has been moved. 
2) The ‘next’ and ‘previous’ arrows have been taken out of the frame, so the Photo looks bigger.
3) ‘Flip’ buttons have been moved.
4) ‘Like’ and ‘Comment’ Buttons have been moved.
  

Also, you can see that instead darkening the frame to make the picture in focus, it makes the background lighter.
  

**Pros and Cons**
  

**Pros**

- The ugly black ‘frame’ around the photo has been removed.
- More Space for the Photo
- Not too dark, less contrast
- Makes the photo look better in Focus
- Photo sizes enlarged
- With this feature, facebook also promised to – 

 1) Increase the Quality of Existing Images
 2) Make the uploading process easier and faster
 3) High Quality Picture Support 
  

**Cons**
  


- The exit button is now farther away, making it sometimes tough to close the picture
