Just created a new Photoshop background, after a long, long, time. This time, it’s blue, and it’s Tron-ish (I’m talking about the newer one…)
  

Made out of boredom and out of jealousy ( I mean, if, a photo like this can get so much oopmh, why not <strike>zoidberg</strike> create one like it?)


So here you go, my latest project.
