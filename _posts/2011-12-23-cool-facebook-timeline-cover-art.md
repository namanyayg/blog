Facebook recently launched the new timeline. It is a kind of new profile for us users. Ofcourse, the first thing that a person sees is the ‚ÄúCover‚Äù of your timeline. So, you want it to be as attractive as possible.  
You can make a cover quite easily with photoshop. Here‚Äôs what I made :

Make a cool one if you can, otherwise, just comment! I‚Äôll make one for you‚Ä¶ üòÄ
