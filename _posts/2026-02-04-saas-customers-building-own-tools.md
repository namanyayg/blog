SaaS is the most profitable business model on Earth.[^1] It's easy to understand why: build once, sell the same thing again ad infinitum, and don't suffer any marginal costs on more sales.

I have been writing software for more than half my life. In the last year, I've talked to hundreds of founders and operators in SF, from preseed to Series E companies. And everyone is constantly talking about the threat looming over us all, that has changed how our entire industry thinks an operates: agentic AI, or an intelligent machine that always listens to you and can write code and take actions, available almost as cheaply as drinking water from a tap.

This is bringing an existential threat to a lot of B2B SaaS executives: How to keep asking customers for renewal, when every customer _feels_ they can get something better built with vibe-coded AI products?

## Wait, can customers actually compete with B2B SaaS through vibe coding?

Short answer: Not really (but that doesn't matter here.)

Long answer: The bigger problem is that customers can get _something_ working with vibe coding, maybe a workflow improvement built on top of their existing integrations. They don't know what actually goes into making data models and systems that work reliably for all scenarios. And that _incomplete knowledge_ is a bit dangerous. 

There are tens of vibe coding "internal tool" services that promise to connect to every integration in the world to pump out CRUD and workflow apps, and they often work.

And vibe coding is fun. Whatever anyone says about AI code generation, it's an unparalleled experience to vibe code your first tool and start using it in your own company. You feel like a mad wizard using the right incantation [^2] to get this magical new silicon intelligence to do exactly what you want. It looks and feel exactly like you want it to.

Whatever they build _simply works_. It takes some wrangling to get there (one Series C VP listed 11 different vibe coding tools they've tried and the pros and cons between each on a phone call once), but productivity gains are immediate. 

What they might not understand is that a poorly architected system will fail. Some patching will work, but anyone who's got experience with maintaining their own custom Linux installation in the 2010s knows how painful it is to maintain and debug software that you rely on day-to-day as it gets more complex and interconnected. As every senior programmer eventually understands, coding is the easy part. Most of our job's complexity is to understand the relationships in the real world, the processes involved, and the workflows needed, and representing it in a robust way to create a stable system.

Non-programmers don't know that, though. One Series E CEO told me that they're re-evaluating the quarterly renewal of their engineering productivity software because they along with an engineer reimplemented something using Github and Notion APIs. They were paying $X0,000 to a popular tool[^3], and they **were not going to renew anymore.**

## So how does it impact my B2B sales?

The reason behind all this is that customers are demanding more from their B2B vendors. Previously, you would change how your company worked to fit what your ERP needs. Now, everyone can see that agentic coding makes an unprecedented level of flexibility possible. And customers are demanding that flexibility, or they're going to make it themselves.

I recently heard a Series B AE talk about how they're potentially losing an $X00,000 account just because the customer can't use a specific failure reporting workflow in the SaaS. 

## How to survive

### 1. Be System of Record, not just as pretty wrappers

If the entire company's workflows operates on your platform, i.e. you're a line-of-business SaaS, you are integrated into their existing team already. They know your UI and rely on you on the day to day. 

This is compared to a simpler wrapper product, e.g. now to create a data visualization I won't seek any SaaS but I'll just code one myself using many of the popular vibe coding tools.

Being a "System of Record" is the way to be so deeply embedded that there's no choice but to win.

### 2. Adapt to the customer, not the other way around

This is the most important. The times of asking customers to change how they work are gone. Now, SaaS vendors that differentiate by being ultra customizable win the hearts of customers.

Why? Because first, it increases usage. We've all heard the classic SaaS problem where the software is sold at the beginning of the year, but no one actually ends up using it because of how inflexible it is and the amount of training needed. 

This is the case with one of my customers, they have a complex SaaS for maintenance operations. But turns out, this was not being used at the technician level because they found the UI too complex[^4]. 

When they heard of my solution they were immediately onboard. My product is essentially a whitelabelled vibe-coding platform with in-built distribution and secure deployments. Their customer success teams quickly coded a very specific mobile webapp for the technicians to use, deployed it in a day, and now it's being used by the entire company for various usage. 

For the IC technician, they are exposed to just those parts of the SaaS that they care about i.e. creating maintenance work orders. The executives get what they want too, they are able to vibe code custom reports exactly the way they want vs going through complicated BI config. Usage was previously 15% in that segment, and is now over 70%. They are now working closely to vibe code new "micro-apps" that works according to _their workflows_ and do exactly what they need, on top of their existing SaaS which works as a system of record.

This basically guarantees renewal and expansion, because no other SaaS was able to offer the customer this level of flexibility. (If you are interested in giving your end-users the same flexibility, <a href="#" onclick="getDemo()">let's chat</a>. My customers tell me that this is the best way to increase retention, usage, and expansion in 2026.)

### 3. Security, authentication, and robustness

These are the hard parts of getting software that works right. Unfortunately, the customers don't know it yet. This needs to be communicated to continue retention, while also working on #1 and #2 so customers have no reason to start thinking about switching.
