Dropbox is a service for uploading files to the web. It offers you 2 gb space at start, but, you can increase it by buying more space, or referring friends. But more on that later, lets get started for now. [![](https://www.dropbox.com/static/20855/images/logo.png)](https://www.dropbox.com/static/20855/images/logo.png)


Step 1 : Register and Login

You first have to [sign up for dropbox](http://db.tt/JazFP0Jo). You need to enter some of your information, and do remember to choose a strong password.

You will receive a conformation mail on your eMail ID. You are recommended to read the [Dropbox Guide](https://www.dropbox.com/link/36.UCKxOUgcfq).


 Step 2: Download and Install

Once you have logged in, you have to download a file. The file is of 14 mb, and then you have to install it.

I recommend you to change the location of the dropbox folder, as that is where you will put all your files to be uploaded.


 Done! Some Tips

Dropbox is a very useful service for everyone. Here are some basics.

- **Anything you pt in dropbox is private to you.** Except what you put in the public folder, ofcourse.
- **Make files public by putting in the public folder.** Then, you can grab their download link by right clicking on the file, going to drobox, and clicking copy public link.
- **You can share folders with other people using dropbox.** You can use this feature to make team projects. Just right click on the folder, go to dropbox, and when you get to a webpage, just enter the person(s) email ID, and an optional message. You will be notified everytime a file is updated.


 Get More Space

You have two ways to get more space in drop box. One is by [buying more space](https://www.dropbox.com/plans). You get 50 gb space by paying 9.99$ per month, or 99$ per year. You get 100gb space by paying 19.99$ per month, or 199$ per year. Other is to [invite your friends](https://www.dropbox.com/referrals). You can get 8gb more by inviting friends. Each friend invited will give you 256mb of space.[Hope you like dropbox, and use it.](http://db.tt/JazFP0Jo)
