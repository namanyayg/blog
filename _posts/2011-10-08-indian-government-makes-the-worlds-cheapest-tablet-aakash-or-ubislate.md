Aakash is the name of a tablet, which is advertised as the world’s cheapest, made by Datawind under the retail name Ubislate. It Features a 7″ Touch Screen, as well as Android 2.2. The word Aakash means ‘Sky’ in Hindi.The Indian Government has payed a lot for Aakash. Actually, Aakash’s Selling Price (35$ for students) is lower than its price for making. Actual Price for the making of Aakash is 45$, which means that the government is paying 10$ for every Aakash sold to students.   

It is mainly aimed at bringing education to villages, but, is also good for junior/middle school students.  
  

\[I know this Post is not timely, but one of my loyal readers, kartik, requested a review of Aakash. Thanks kartik for reading my blog!! You can [find kartik on Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1413202889), too!\]| [![](http://www.aakashtablet.com/images/mig1.jpg)](http://www.aakashtablet.com/images/mig1.jpg) |

| Aakash or Ubislate. Comes with Android 2.2 and 7 Inch Touchscreen. |

If you want a Aakash, you can preorder it from it’s Official site, [Aakashtablet.com](http://aakashtablet.com/). Alternatively, you can also call 1800-180-2180 (toll free)
  

It is guessed that the government will be distributing models in Colleges and University’s for free.. As a test. Then, they will have student discounts (after the free distribution stock has ended) for which each tablet will cost 35$. Finally, the retail version thought to come after a time of 1 year is going to cost 60$. Now for the review. Hope this helps you to better decide to buy a Aakash or not.

- 7 inch Touchscreen
- HD Video Processor

**The Bad-**

- Resistive Touch Screen

- Ram – Only 256 mb


**The Downright Ugly-**

One of the main conflicts here is, that I do not think that a 256 mb ram could handle HD Videos. 256mb Ram handling HD? Impossible!  

Second is that the manufacturing company, Datawind, has little to no experience in terms of making tablets. The government (most probably) chose them because the offered a cheap price…  

And, the Worst of all, 3 Hour Battery Life!! 3 Hours is not even the whole school timings!! How is some student going to use it??  

And, a Resistive Touch Screen? I know there were price restricts, but, Resistive Touchscreens have gone old.   

That’s with it. Feel free to comment with more points, and why do you like/hate the Aakash Tablet.
