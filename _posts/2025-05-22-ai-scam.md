*Reddit discovered the funniest thing in tech this week, and it shows exactly how broken the AI narrative is.*

The newly released GitHub Copilot agent was given permission to make pull requests on Microsoft's .NET runtime, and the results couldn't be funnier. 

The AI confidently submitted broken code, while human developers patiently explained why it didn't work. Over and over again, for days.

What's worse is that CEOs are using this same technology to **justify laying off entire engineering teams.**

## Comedy show

I spent way too much time scrolling through these PRs. The pattern was always the same:

* AI: "I fixed the issue!"
* Human: "Your code isn't working and you broke other tests."
* AI: "You're absolutely right! Fixed it now."
* *Still not fixed.*

This went on for days. Multiple rounds of the AI insisting it solved problems, while making them worse.

And somewhere, executives are watching this thinking, _"Yeah, this is ready to replace our engineering team."_

## Hidden truth

I don't want to sound like an AI hater, I use AI for coding daily. It's genuinely made me more productive.

But here's what's actually happening with these layoffs: Companies over-hired during the pandemic boom. Now they need to cut costs. AI gave them the perfect cover story.

Instead of admitting _"We planned poorly,"_ they get to sound visionary: _"We're leveraging AI to optimize workforce efficiency!"_

Meanwhile, I know a startup founder who just raised Series A. He messaged me about wanting to hire three more engineers.

"Aren't you using AI to do more with fewer people?" I asked.

He laughed. "AI makes my team unstoppable. Why would I want fewer unstoppable people?"

## What devs need to do right now

If you're worried about AI layoffs, here's your playbook:

<!-- newsletter_widget -->

<ul>
<li><strong>Become the AI expert on your team.</strong> Don't fight the tools, master them. Be <a href="/blog/ai-and-learning">the person who knows when AI helps and when it hurts.</a><br><br>

Management needs someone who understands both the potential and limitations.<br><br></li>

<li><strong>Document everything AI can't do.</strong> Keep a running list of complex problems you solve that AI suggestions couldn't handle. Things like system design decisions, business logic that required domain knowledge, or bugs that needed deep debugging.<br><br>

This is not just paranoia, it is to properly understand AI, for yourself and for your team.<br><br></li>

<li><strong>Make it public.</strong> Share your real AI experiences on social media. Post screenshots of AI failing at complex tasks alongside examples where it actually helped. Show the world that human + AI is the future, not AI alone. <br><br>

The world is watching. Share the truth about AI. If you don't, then who will?<br><br></li>

<li><strong>Create the narrative.</strong> Every time you solve something AI couldn't, tweet about it. When AI helps you ship faster, share that too. <br><br>

The goal isn't to bash AI, it's to show that the <em>most powerful combination</em> is skilled developers using AI as a force multiplier. Make <em>yourself</em> the obvious choice for companies that want to win.</li>
</ul>

## The bottom line

If your CEO is talking about AI layoffs, update your resume. Not because AI will replace you, but because you're working for someone who thinks a technology that [can't understand a simple bug](/blog/ai-illiterate-programmers) is ready to run their engineering org.

AI has become a part of software development, but it isn't perfect. Humans are needed more than ever.

And if you want proof, just check those [Microsoft PRs](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/1krttqo/my_new_hobby_watching_ai_slowly_drive_microsoft/){:target="_blank"}. The AI is still confidently wrong. The humans are still patiently fixing everything.

So trust me, your job is safe.
