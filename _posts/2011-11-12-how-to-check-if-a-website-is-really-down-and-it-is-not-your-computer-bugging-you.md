Sometimes, when you visit a website, it infinitely loads and you canâ€™t access the page. This is because the server of the site are down due to a power cut/antimatter spawn/wiring problem/any other reasonâ€¦ We call the servers being off as the site being â€˜downâ€™. A Useful tool will tell you that is there a problem in your PC that you canâ€™t access the site, or is the site down for everyone!
