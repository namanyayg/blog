If you're using Cursor like everyone else, you're essentially lighting money on fire. 

I discovered this the hard way after burning through my monthly credits in just 8 days (again.) The problem isn't Cursor's pricing; it's how we're using it.

Most developers don't realize is that each "request" in Cursor can handle up to 25 tool calls before it's considered complete. That single "hey, add types to this function" burns an entire request slot, even though you could have asked 24 more questions in that same session.

I was one of those developers. *Until I built something that changed everything.*

## The $$$ Mistake I Made

Two months ago, I was working on my AI tool when I hit a wall. Not a technical wall — a financial one. I was burning through Cursor's $20 monthly subscription in less than two weeks, then paying extra fees every month.

The breaking point came during a particularly brutal debugging session. I had asked Cursor to help fix a React component, and after getting the solution, I realized I needed to refactor the entire parent component too. And in the middle of all this, Cursor decided that my $20 worth of requests was used up. I was relegated to the annoying "slow requests", and that too in the middle of an important debugging session.

That's when I started digging into Cursor's actual usage patterns.

## Economics

After analyzing my usage data, I discovered something that made me question everything. On average, I was using only 2.3 tool calls per request. Out of 25 possible calls. That's a 91% efficiency loss.

Here's the math that'll make you sick: if you're paying $20/month for 500 requests, you're actually paying for 12,500 potential tool calls. Each tool call, if you bought it separately, would be worth about $0.016. That means your $20 subscription has a potential value of $200 if fully utilized.

But if you're like most developers using only 2.3 calls per request, you're extracting just $18.40 worth of value from a $200 potential. You're leaving $181.60 on the table every single month.

**Scale that across a year, and you're missing out on $2,179 in potential value.** For a team of 10 developers? That's $21,790 annually in unrealized productivity — enough to fund an entire additional developer position.

## Building the Solution

I tried the obvious solutions first. Cursor's built-in chat history, longer prompts, batch requests. Nothing worked consistently. The problem wasn't the tool; it was the workflow.

So I built something simple. Stupidly simple. An [MCP](https://gigamind.dev/cost-optimizer?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=cursor-cost-optimizer&utm_campaign=cursor-cost-optimizer) that keeps Cursor sessions alive until you've extracted maximum value from each request. No complex UI, no fancy features — just a persistent conversation loop that ensures you use all 25 tool calls before moving on. It prompts you for the next instruction, maintaining context while maximizing your request efficiency. 

## Results

After implementing this system:

* My monthly Cursor costs dropped from $47 (including overages) to $20
* I complete projects 3x faster due to maintained context
* Zero workflow interruption — it feels like natural conversation
* My effective cost per interaction went from $0.094 to $0.008

**That's a 1,075% improvement in value extraction.** Or put another way: I'm now getting $200+ worth of value from my $20 subscription instead of barely $20 worth.

## The Bottom Line

Every developer I've shared this with has the same reaction: "Why didn't I discover this sooner?" 

If you're serious about optimizing your development workflow (and your wallet), you need to start thinking about how AI tools work under the hood. The math is undeniable: you're either maximizing your requests or you're funding someone else's optimization.

The choice is yours. But at $200+ in potential savings per month, can you really afford not to optimize?
