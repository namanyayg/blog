Click on get started, Login if you haven’t already.  
It will then ask you to download a file, and after that you can Video chat with your friends!  
If the [video chat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videotelephony "Videotelephony") is not working, share the link with your friend and ask them to download too. Then re try and you can start video chatting!

Video chat on facebook is provided by skype. Though the quality is not matching those of Google+ , it is still quite good. Remember, if you want a G+ invite, buy one at <http://sellingginvites.blogspot.com/>
