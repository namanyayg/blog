Hello Guys! I am up with a new blog. If you had seen the post about ‘Monetize New Blogs’, you’d see that the blog didn’t turn out so well. I didn’t post ANYTHING ( I decided to stick with adsense, don’t like the othes :P)


But, now, I am back with another blog. [Faceb Tricks](http://facebtricks.blogspot.com/), AKA [Facebook Tips n Tricks](http://facebtricks.blogspot.com/).


This one is what I have worked with, Not like the Monetize New Blogs, in which I didn’t even lookup a theme, or made a decent logo.For this one, check out a simple-but-effective logo-

The font is [Klavika Bold Bold](http://www.fontyukle.net/en/Klavika+Bold+Bold.ttf), and the Colour is #3B5998 which is the RGB of 59, 89, 152.


I am still seeking Inspiration for A Favicon, and A Horizontal Logo, so hit me up if you have one in the comments!










(PS: If you were wondering if why I made a Square logo before a Horizontal One, You can soon read it on Faceb Tricks)
