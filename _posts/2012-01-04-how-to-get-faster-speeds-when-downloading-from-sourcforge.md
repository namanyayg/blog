Almost all of them gave me slow speeds (around 2-5% of my max download speed), so I started looking for a trick to increase it, and finally discovered one. Now, my downloads from it are 90-95% of my download speeds. 

### The Trick

- While you are downloading a file, click on the link “try another mirror.”

- You will be back on the download, but it will download a lot faster.

**Alternative tip**  
There is also another workaround. Just add`?use_mirror=autoselect` after the link.
