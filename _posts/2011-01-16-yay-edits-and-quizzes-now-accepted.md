Hiya Pals! I now accept people giving me their pics to edit! To do so, comment on this post by clicking the name of the post (the title, which is given in bold and underlined) and then using the post a comment section. Then, putting the link (the link is what you see where you type google.com)of the image. to do so, go to the image, copy paste the link, and paste it in the comment section. Now you may specify all the stuff you want to be done, from cleaning up your hair, to replacing your head with someoneâ€™s body!(some may require the background to be changed, so give a background if you want it to be applied!) if the privacy of the info is a concern, first comment here, then mail your pic and detail to namanyay.goel@yahoo.co.in

As you may have seen, the title also contains about quizzes! To do so, comment any 10 ques and answers about yourself. You can mail me the answers if you want to challenge your friends, and wish that they dont cheat :P. After you have done that, you can tell me what colours to use for text, background etc. Then i will make you a quiz with the question given, and 2 options. The scores will be tallied in the end. You can tell me anything you want to be customized, from background (colour and look) to the display info you want. You will first have to comment, then we can use e mail. I will be posting a quiz about me soon, so you can see how it looks like! Byah, and be sure to share and comment!
