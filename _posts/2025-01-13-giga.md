*Modern software development is complex. Our projects have hundreds of files, intricate dependencies, and carefully thought-out architectural decisions.*

## The Problem

Anyone who's used AI coding assistants has experienced this: you ask for help with a feature, and the AI generates code that completely ignores your existing patterns. Or worse, it breaks your carefully planned architecture.

After experiencing this frustration firsthand, I started building Giga&mdash;a different kind of AI coding assistant that maintains deep, persistent understanding of your entire codebase.

## How Giga Works
The core innovation in Giga is what I call the "project brain"&mdash;a smart context management system that:

* Automatically analyzes your project structure, dependencies, and architectural patterns
* Maintains a living SPEC.md file that captures your project's technical decisions and constraints
* Integrates with git to track meaningful changes and evolve its understanding
* Uses this persistent context to ensure AI suggestions align perfectly with your existing architecture

## Early Results
The initial beta testing has been enlightening. Developers report that Giga:

* Eliminates the need to repeatedly explain project structure to AI
* Significantly reduces instances of AI suggestions breaking existing architecture
* Maintains consistent understanding even as codebases grow
