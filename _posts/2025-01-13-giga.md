Modern software development is complex. Our projects have hundreds of files, intricate dependencies, and carefully thought-out architectural decisions. 

While AI coding assistants are powerful, they often feel like well-meaning but forgetful colleagues&mdash;you have to keep reminding them about your project structure, tech choices, and coding patterns.

## The Problem

Anyone who's used AI coding assistants has experienced this: you ask for help with a feature, and the AI generates code that completely ignores your existing patterns. Or it suggests using a library you've intentionally avoided. Or worse, it breaks your carefully planned architecture because it doesn't understand the relationships between different parts of your codebase.

The root cause? Current AI tools process your code in fragments, without maintaining persistent understanding of your project's full context. They're like developers who join your team but never quite grasp the big picture of how everything fits together.

After experiencing this frustration firsthand, I started building Giga&mdash;a different kind of AI coding assistant that maintains deep, persistent understanding of your entire codebase.

## How Giga Works
The core innovation in Giga is what I call the "project brain"&mdash;a smart context management system that:

* Automatically analyzes your project structure, dependencies, and architectural patterns
* Maintains a living SPEC.md file that captures your project's technical decisions and constraints
* Integrates with git to track meaningful changes and evolve its understanding
* Uses this persistent context to ensure AI suggestions align perfectly with your existing architecture

## Early Results
The initial beta testing has been enlightening. Developers report that Giga:

* Eliminates the need to repeatedly explain project structure to AI
* Significantly reduces instances of AI suggestions breaking existing architecture
* Works particularly well with modern web stacks (Next.js + TypeScript)
* Maintains consistent understanding even as codebases grow

## Join the Beta
I'm looking for early users who have medium to large codebases and are interested in shaping the future of AI-assisted development.

The beta is ready. To get early access, [join our Discord community](https://discord.gg/KY7dVeFKRR). I need your help to make Giga the best AI coding assistant it can be.

Looking forward to building something meaningful together!
