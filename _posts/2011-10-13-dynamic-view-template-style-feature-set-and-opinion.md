Dynamic Views – The latest invention by Blogger“Last week, we launched Dynamic Views in an effort to make it easier for readers to enjoy and discover your posts. You responded. As of today, hundreds of thousands of blogs have changed their blog template to Dynamic Views. The clear favorite appears to be Magazine, with Classic running a close second.”[From the Official Blogger Blogpost](http://buzz.blogger.com/2011/10/dynamic-views-update-1.html)

**Behind the Scenes, and promised updates-**

Dynamic Views is the latest view style by Blogger. It works on HTML5, Javascript, and CSS3. You can think of Dynamic Views as Themes. They are like different ‘Cameras’ To a blog. You can look at a blog with one Camera, or from the other one. Dynamic Views change how templates work. Now, a user can choose from a drop down list how they wish to see a blog. They could look at it as a Collage, a Magazine, or like a Scrapbook, altering the experience of the viewer.Blogger Dynamic Views have new, Web 2.0 buttons, are easier to share, and you can get **all of the posts** in a quick and easy way, without using ‘Older Posts’. Images are also loaded better. As we know that New Dynamic Views work with HTML5, Javascript and CSS3, Blogger needs to change its code. Blogger says that they are starting out with Gadgets, and you should see around 10 new gadgets in the upcoming week.Another update promised is more control of how Blogger looks. If you are using Dynamic Views, you will see that there are many limits. Blogger says that they are going to release more functionality, and the best part is the release of editing of your blog’s backround image. 

**What it has, and what it Does –**

Nothing Defines Dynamic Views better other than the [Post on Blogger Buzz](http://buzz.blogger.com/2011/09/dynamic-views-seven-new-ways-to-share.html). There are 7 different types of views-- Classic ([Gmail](http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/)): A modern twist on a traditional template, with infinite scrolling and images that load as you go.


- Flipcard ([M loves M](http://mlovesm.blogspot.com/view/flipcard)) – Your photos are tiled across the page and flip to reveal the post title.
- Magazine ([Advanced Style](http://advancedstyle.blogspot.com/view/magazine)) – A clean, elegant editorial style layout
- Mosaic ([Crosby’s Kitchen](http://crosbykitchen.blogspot.com/view/mosaic)) – A mosaic mix of different sized images and text.
- Sidebar ([Blogger Buzz Blog](http://buzz.blogger.com/)) – An email inbox-like view with a reading page for quick scrolling and browsing.
- Snapshot ([Canelle et Vanille](http://cannelle-vanille.blogspot.com/view/snapshot)) – An interactive pinboard of your posts
- Timeslide ([The Bleary-Eyed Father](http://blearyeyedfather.blogspot.com/view/timeslide)) – A horizontal view of your posts by time period.


They were made in mind for bloggers trouble finding Templates. As Blogger knows, their Default Templates are not *too* nice. The majority of bloggers **don’t** use the Default Template. You could use Flipcard or Snapshot if you have a photo blog, while Classic, Sidebar or Timeline would be more suitable for text-based blogs. Blogger Buzz uses the ‘Sidebar’ Style now.


**How to use it-**

You can access the new template styles from your blog’s Template Designer, or the Templates Page.

**All my Humble opinions-**

In my opinion, Classic and sidebar styles are best, but a major loss is the lack of a ‘sidebar’; that is, the place where you have gadgets. It is not known what a typical blogger would make of it. The new Views lack only this functionality, which is not very appealing to bloggers. Dynamic views were created for Photo/Video Loggers, and have little to no use for mainstream users. The snapshot and other styles are a clear indication of that.The Text on a single webpage looks cluttered, and most of them do not have a sidebar! This is not good for mainstream bloggers.But the good point is, that it has more of a web 2.0-ish feel and look, and the new share buttons and comment buttons look well.

**Pros And Cons-**

** Pros- **

- Nice Graphics and Functionality.
- Web 2.0-ish Buttons.
- Infinite Scrolling (No need for ‘Older Posts’).
- Improvements to ‘Search’ Feature.
- New Keyboard Shortcuts.
- Easier to share on Social Networks (Especially Google Plus).


**Cons- **

- Not good for bloggers who have high word Count.
- No sidebar in most of the Themes.
- Only good for bloggers with lots of Images.
- Looks Cluttered.
- Not much in the field of Customization.


You may have liked it, but I am not using the new dynamic views. In my opinion it has a lot more to refine, and good be a lot better. I will consider waiting a week or two. Also, not all my existing gadgets are compatible with the views. And my high word count just makes the whole look a lot cluttered. Maybe more improvements in fonts, more tweaks, would make it just what bloggers (including me!) are waiting for.
