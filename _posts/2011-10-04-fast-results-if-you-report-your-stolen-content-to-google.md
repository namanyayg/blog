If you had read my earlier post regarding Googleâ€™s DMCA, and how to use it, you wouldâ€™ve come to known that a blog was copying stuff off me. So, I went to Google, and reported it. Within a day, I got a reply that the content had been removed. Sure enough, the content he had ripped off me was completely gone.
